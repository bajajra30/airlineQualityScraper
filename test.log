 'text': u' |  I fly EasyJet weekly between London and Budapest so have accumulated a representative view of their service on this route, and tonight\'s flight from Budapest to London is not unusual.  It\'s cheap, they fly to Gatwick, planes are new and crew professional and friendly. The flights are almost always late, due to ground handling issues. Twice this week, I have been delayed (1 hour tonight, 2.5 hours Monday) due to the water not being cleared and replaced on the aircraft when it should. On Monday this resulted in me getting to my apartment 3 hours late at 1am. Tonight this resulted in passengers flushing the toilets manually using bottles of mineral water provided by the crew and using a hand sanitiser to "wash" hands. For the second time this week, there was also no hot or cold food. Tonight, not for the first time, we were then dropped at the South Terminal at Gatwick rather than the North as scheduled, leaving people to find their way to their cars, taxis or friends at the other terminal. I have now reached the point where if I have a choice of airline on a route, I will choose another than EasyJet, even if it costs substantially more. I used to be a fan of EasyJet, but having become a regular flyer with them over the last year, I can no longer recommend them.',

The last two times we incurred over two hours delay due to "passenger removal" and security checks. Only water provided during the long waiting on the plane. They used to do food service with two trolleys: one starting from the front and one starting from the back of the aircraft. They now start with two trolleys from the front and no sandwiches are available when reaching the last five seating rows. Disgraceful. No interest whatsoever if there are small children. It used to be a very good company, now it simply is a cattle transport. I and my family will never use easyJet ever again. Quite frankly the tickets are in reason of 200/250 GBP per person every time we travel so not interesting anymore for this kind of dis-service.',

The flight (Barcelona to Basel) was an hour late leaving the gate because of some technical breakdown. Once we started taxiing it took more than 30 min to get off the ground. Not clear why the taxi took so long but we could have driven around the entire airport several times in that time. They have luggage requirements different from all other airlines. They appear to make all of their money running this luggage con. You can only have a single piece of luggage. They don't tell you during the long wait in line either. They purposely wait until you are just about to board so you don't have time to re-arrange your luggage. If you do manage to consolidate your luggage, they are waiting and ready to throw the other shoe at you: oh that luggage is too bulky and/or heavy. They charge you 60\u20ac to check an extra bag. It is that or miss your flight. They are not even polite about it. 6 of us got caught in exactly the same way on this flight. After that, the ticket price is no longer competitive. Adding insult to injury, the luggage bins in the cabin are huge and could easily fit luggage much larger than ours and we flew with them all half empty. Nothing free is offered in flight to eat or drink. What they do sell is grossly over priced. The last straw was at the arrival, walking up and down stairs with droves of other people down long tunnels. Additionally, they took forever to send the luggage to the belt at destination basically guaranteeing we would miss our train at the destination. We are dreading the return flight which will be tomorrow. Never again.",

Flight eventually left at 1am next morning, so should be home shortly. Apparently previous crew had run out of flying hours so a replacement crew had to be drafted in to get us home. The plane starts to descend to land at Gatwick, wheels down and then a steep pull up, full power and we are back up, pilot then tells us that as we are so late the main runway is closed for repairs so he attempted to land on second runway but due to bad lighting and visibility he aborted landing. He was then going to circle for 15 mins while they re-opened the main runway. Next announcement was "welcome to Stansted". We were then told to wait on the plane while they sorted coaches for onward travel. 20 mins later were we told to make our way to arrivals for the transport home but once we were in arrivals we were then told to make our own way home (2am in the morning) and seek compensation on the EasyJet website. We eventually arrived back in Gatwick at 9am, another day off work. So far, now 22nd August, despite many calls and letters we have received no compensation, no refund of our bus fares, no explanation. EasyJet Customer Service is anything but a customer service. They have employed every tactic to not give us a straight answer. When everything is ok, they give a good service, when it goes wrong, lookout. In reality we could have flown 1st class on BA for what it has actually cost us for these "cheap" seats.',

Their ground facilities will be using the worst and most out-of-they way parts of the airport they are flying to and from (in my case Terminal H from Schiphol, which is the least pleasant part of the airport, despite being relatively new, and London Stansted, of which many more passengers than I have already fittingly described on this site). Any extra service above getting you and only you to your destination will have to be paid for. However, the aircraft themselves seem clean enough, and for short haul flights are adequate.',

No reasonable explanation was given for the delay.

 'text': u' |  We booked a summer vacation to Europe - landing in Paris. We used EasyJet to book airfare from Paris-Barcelona-Paris and a week later for Paris-Napes-Paris. Trip to Barcelona was odd in that they routed us out of the terminal, onto busses, then to a plane on tarmac - similar debark in Barcelona.  Inconvenient, slow. On the return trip, an EasyJet staffer pulled us out of line, measured our bags. One bag was 1" too long. She said only on purse or bag was allowed per passenger. We were charge 240 euros on the spot to return home. Later looking online, it is less clear about 1 bag. 1 bag/purse per passenger is general, but in many cases 1 purse and 1 carry-on bag is allowed. Very confusing.  I can embrace the concept of a low-cost carrier but be clear about what you\'re not offering. Not even water, soda, juice or crackers was provided. Seats do not recline. Friendly helpful service was non-existent. Staff at BCN to help with complaints did not exist either. Worse was to come. 4 hours before we were to leave for our early morning flight - we received 3am text message saying our flight was cancelled due to illness by one of the flight crew. Had I not happen to wake up and check my phone at 3:30am, we would have been totally screwed. As it was, I spent two hours in the middle of the night trying to find a last minute flight for 4 one-way tickets to Naples.  EasyJet booked the flight and return flight 1 week later. The return flight was an Air France flight. That wasn\'t cancelled. So, now I needed one-way tickets (expensive) and last minute (even more expensive). What did EasyJet offer in compensation? They would rebook me (at no charge) another flight to Naples or refund my purchase price for the tickets. Two issues.  Next available EasyJet flight was 5 days later (bye-bye vacation).  Value as for 1/2 round fair purchased a month ago. I will never fly EasyJet again. Wish I could rate lower than a 1. For the last kick in the pants, EasyJet also booked my rental car. Though I was clearly booking a 7 day trip to Naples, they only reserved the rental car for 1 day.',

 'text': u' |  I travelled from Belfast International to Malaga on 17th May of this year with Easyjet. Tried to book extra legroom but was told no seats were available so despite being 6ft 4ins tall I found myself in a middle seat between aisle and window. In normal circumstances I could endure this for a short three hour flight, however, a fate would have it the seat in front wouldn\'t stay in an upright position - it was in a permanent reclining position - it was broken. I asked the Stewardess if there was any remedy to this situation and she told me the plane was full but she would see what she could do, which was reasonable. She seemed to forget her promise as she never came back to me so I sat with the Lady in front practically sitting on my lap. After a couple of hours I decided to visit the toilet at the front of the plane, and saw the front three seats were totally vacant. So I sat down on one of them as there was only an hour left of the flight. The Chief Stewardess rudely asked me why I was sitting there so I told her that row 16 seat was broken. She said I would have to pay extra to sit at the front so I asked her if I would get a refund for sitting in the broken seat for the previous two hours - she said not and that I would have to return to my broken seat. As a matter of principle I refused to pay extra for the last hour of the flight and returned to Row 16. On my return home I sent a complaint to Easyjet on 29th May. I received the following response right back "Dear easyJet Customer Thank you for contacting easyJet via our online form. We aim to reply to you within 3days, although in busy periods this may be longer. We\u2019ll be in touch soon. Regards, easyJet Customer Services". That was on 29th May 2016 - it is now 3rd August 2016, almost ten weeks later and I haven\'t heard anything more from Easyjet. Seems they must be very busy with complaints which doesn\'t surprise me one little bit. I am a reasonable person who realises that things go wrong now and then but the disgraceful attitude of staff onboard and the total ignoring of my post-flight complaint proves to me that Customer Service is very low on the priority list.

We went to gate 55D which was the same gate the Glasgow flight which had been called earlier. After about half an hour of trying to figure out who was at gate 55D they decided to move the Edinburgh passengers. They moved us to gate 54 which was back through the check in desk. On getting there we were told we could get through. So the 100 or so passengers were trapped in a glass corridor in the blistering heat. After another half an hour they decided to move us in to what looked like a departure lounge that time forgot. Basically seats and that was it. I asked one time during the next half hour if could visit the bathroom and was told no. When an announcement finally came. The first one of the day I hasten to add the the flight was cancelled. We then had to wait about an hour until they decided to escort us out of the airport through passport control, even though we were domestic which took another half hour. After finally getting out of departures we were expected to stand in a queue for cutover services with one person on the desk. I'm pretty sure I would have been there 2 days later which ironically was the next flight they were offering. I know eastJet is cheap but if it wasn't my company that booked the flights I wouldn't fly with easyjet ever again.",

 'text': u" |  I fly with easyJet at least three times per week.  Yesterday's flight from Edinburgh to Gatwick was delayed by an hour. We then lost time for some unknown reason and arrived even later. When we arrived at Gatwick the pilot couldn't park the plane and we had to wait another 30 minutes for a tug to push the plane into position to enable the jetty to be attached. If I wasn't tired and hungry it would have been comical. Today boarding should have commenced 50 minutes ago, we have been left standing for 50 minutes with absolutely no explanation in the sweltering heat of the departure lounge. So it looks like my return journey will have a similar farcical delay. If you are flying the Edinburgh to Gatwick route, do yourself a favour and use British Airways. You will be surprised how similar the fares are. And for the record, I am not a British Airways employee, I am a disgruntled Easyjet customer.

 'text': u' |  I am extremely frustrated with easyJet after our flight from Paris to Nice. Not only was this an expensive flight for a short trip in Europe but the attendants at the gate were very rude. The website says that you have to pay 60\u20ac for an extra bag (in a subtle way), so you must know that going into it. Unfortunately, we did not know this policy until we get to the gate and they aggressively asked for our money. After traveling throughout Europe for some time, we have never had any problem with our baggage. Most airlines have allowed one small bag and one overhead bag, so while we still have all of that luggage, we have to pay for what they already have space for on their flight. Furthermore, once we had boarded the flight, we noticed ample space in all of the overhead luggage compartments for the bags while they had specifically said at the gate that due to the full flight, they could not fit our baggage. They charge you for all food and beverages as well. The policies this airline holds are frankly absurd as they try to rip you off. Definitely not worth what you pay for. They advertise themselves as a cheap airlines while instead you will probably have to pay the price of a much nicer flight. However, they do leave on time and their boarding process goes quickly.',

Dreading the long wait for our flight my partner suggested we go to the airport and ask if we could change our flight. I was quite adament that this could not be done unless you paid either over the odds or paid for another seat. We went to the airport and asked the member of staff at the easy jet desk if we could change our flight. She replied of course and had us on the eariler flight leaving at 5.40pm. This was done in the space of 5 minutes and no extra cost at all. We were delayed going out and coming back but not for long and these are things that cannot be helped.

Finally I board to sit next to an overweight undershowered fellow. All we got offered was a glass of tap water. Got to hand it to easyJet though, they managed to get us back in 2h50min, just 10mins shy of the limit to get our money back. Avoid this company.\r\n',

 'text': u" |  London Gatwick to Arrecife, Lanzarote. I've been flying with Easyjet for about 7 years, mostly to the Canaries. Over the years, I could see a great deal of improvement in the service, food and aircraft. To begin with, there were three toilets on the plane that took us to Lanzarote and back, all of which had baby changing stations. The food was much better this time around than on any other flight. We opted for the meal deals, and were really impressed with the Corkers crisps and the hot food. They were far tastier than any other on-flight food I've had in over 10 years of flying with state-owned and low-cost airlines. The staff was very attentive, helping me with my baggage, and making sure that I'm aware of the facilities and safety features dedicated to infants. The flight attendants forgot to serve us some of the food, and it took about 15 minutes for the hot food to be served, but that's not something we'd hold against them, considering they were genuinely busy. There was a general sense of calm and consideration for other people, with passengers willing to overlook the noise and fuss our children made, and I believe that's down to how the staff carried themselves and attended to people's needs. There was a friendly atmoshpere throughout, which helped ease our anxieties over political unrest in the country, and especially attitudes toward migrants. The new Recaro seats are very comfortable and sleek, with plenty of legroom behind and underneath. I don't think low-cost could be much better than this.",

On checking in at Berlin, it's seems ironic, Easyjet state they like you to arrive 2 hours early at the airport yet we couldn't check-in our bag until 2 hrs 10 mins before our flight. Easyjet also tell passengers that they will more likely get their cabin bags in the overhead locker space if they try to board early, we paid for speedy boarding and were amongst the first passengers on board, safely put our bags (smaller than most) in the overhead lockers, yet a guy boards almost last couldn't get his large case in the lockers so the flight attanedant takes mine out and tells me to put it under the seat in front of me, severely restricting space for my feet for the whole flight.

 'text': u'After having used EasyJet with complete satisfaction for about 10 years this has now been overturned by the incompetence of their customer service. On 28 Feb 2016 I was supposed to take a flight from Naples to Paris Orly. Unfortunately this was cancelled due to the weather conditions. Ground staff did all they could to help passengers. We were told to come back the next morning for a new flight scheduled at 9.55. This flight finally departed after 13.00. The reason given by the captain (in Italian and English - translated into French by a stewardess) was that an emergency slide had to be repaired before departure and that he was waiting for the final paperwork. Result was a near 22 hour delay on arrival in Paris. I accept this misfortune could happen with any airline. What I do not accept is that on 15 June I am still waiting for the reimbursement of my out of pocket expenses and that EasyJet have claimed that they do not owe any compensation under European legislation as the flight was delayed due to weather conditions - that was the case for the original flight, but not for the replacement flight. By way of comparison following a mechanical failure on a Flybe flight compensation was finalized within 24 hours. As a result of this experience I have learned to NO longer have any faith in EasyJet and in future shall do all in my power to avoid this airline and to warn potential flyers about their poor after sales service (plenty of bla-bla, but no action).',

 'text': u' |  Flew Gatwick to Jersey. Let\u2019s face it, Easyjet treats their customers like cattle. We boarded the flight which was to be one hour in duration. The flight actually boarded on time and without incident. When everyone was boarded the captain came on to say that the flight was to be delayed because of weather in Jersey. He said it was going to be delayed an hour to start but could be delayed as much as four hours before the flight left. So here was a full flight, in an uncomfortable airplane with children and families on board that was going to just sit. What upsets me here is that the crew knew about this potential delay prior to boarding and still put everyone on the plane. The plane did finally leave, 5 hours later. The passengers were forced to sit on the hot plane with no air, no food, no drinks, for 5 hours. Once the flight left it was a one hour ride to Jersey.',

The price I paid for our flights was low, I decided to book extra legroom seats which made the flight very comfortable and came with automatic Speedy Boarding and an extra bag allowance (I still think Easyjet's policy towards handbags etc. is annoying and unnecessary).

Took our own water on board as know the score in regards food and drink on board. Return flight was same as outbound flight, in fact left bang on time and landed very early. It's worth noting that Terminal 2 at Malpensa is a bit dated but you can see improvements are being made to facilities, this will take time but they'll get there. Facilities were adequate enough and free bus to terminal 1 for train station was easy to find. Used the easyJet app on my phone for check in etc. Impressed as gives you a message when your gate us announced and all that. Works well and easy to use compared to other airline apps.

 'text': u'Manchester to Venice. Due to problem with plane the easyjet Manchester departure was slightly delayed and some passengers could not fly as the plane that was substituted was smaller. We did get on the flight but all our seats were changed, for a short flight and being older children this was not a huge issue but we had paid for allocated seating and it took several unanswered emails and eventually a long and no doubt costly call to Easyjet to try to claim the payment back. They tried to offer me free seat allocation on the next flight, as I\'m hoping never to have to use this airline again I politely refused and was told a refund would be given in 5-10 days - time will tell! Return trip was delayed but no announcement made or info given, when finally boarded in Venice the cabin staff were to say the least brusque, we were seated at very back of flight and of course no room was left for baggage, rather than try to help by checking overheads at the front of the plane a staff member thought it appropriate to just shout at my daughters to sit down, when she explained she had no where to put her baggage and could not "go against the tide" of still boarding passengers to check the front she was told she would just have to put it in the hold, how this was going to be managed by my daughter was not mentioned and clearly the staff were not going to help - eventually another staff member did find some space and called my daughter down from her seat at the back to the front to store her baggage - not a major issue but overall the experience is one of lack of care, whilst safety should always be paramount they seem disorganised at best and uncaring at worst, helping a passenger could actually save them time in the long run and when they are obviously running late and working against a tight time frame you would think that experience would of taught them this - the whole customer service ethos has passed them by and I got the impression on both flights that passengers were very much a necessary evil and the cabin crews life would be so much better if they just didn\'t have to deal with them. Service not great, communication poor, every time I\'ve flown the flight has been delayed, overall worth paying a little more for a better experience.',

When the time comes to board the plane we get the news that takeoff has again been delayed because the plane had reached its weight limit. The flight attendants went around offering passengers trips to different destinations in order to get them off the plane to decrease the weight. After a few passengers left, we got yet another call from the cockpit informing us that we will not be landing in Paris, but in Milan to refuel.  In a matter of minutes we were airborne. Its worth mentioning that the cabin crew had the decency to offer complimentary beverages and snacks to make up for the inconvenience. The food was average, simple meals most of which are sandwiches that I do enjoy. The seats on the flight were uncomfortable. The distance between the seats was insufficient lacking legroom which made the flight uncomfortable. We arrive at Milan only to hear more bad news, we were told that the plane had hit a bird, which meant that we had to change planes. To summarise the story, we arrived at Paris CDG after an 8 hour flight, exactly double the amount of time it should have taken. We had lost half of a day on our short trip, arriving at 5:30am local Paris time instead of 12:30am. We arrived tired, with very little time to sleep.',

After the latest notification, we were informed that we would get voucher of 4.5 Euro for snack (only sandwich). Vouchers were given when they called people for boarding which means basically no time to take the snack. Besides, when they called people for boarding, the plane was not arrived yet! The latest ETD was 23.35 with ETA 00.10 and ATD was 11.31. We landed safely in Lyon, because they mentioned that GVA airport was already closed at midnight and we were not informed before. Considering the ETA was after midnight, they should have seen this possibility but, they did not mention anything to passenger before. We missed our train connection because of the delay and we arranged last minute bus travel which we missed as well due to the arrival was in Lyon. Thankfully they still managed to make bus transfer to GVA airport. We arrived in GVA around 3 AM. Considering the arrival time, the total delay was around 5 hours and we were stuck in GVA airport at 3 AM. Very bad experience.',

 'text': u" |  Copenhagen to Gatwick check-in was done on the app, and I didn't have any checkin baggage, so went straight to departure. The boarding gate and arrival gate were both very far from the airport main shopping area. Especially in CPH, the easyJet and Ryanair boarding area F is the farthest among all the boarding gates. The seat pitch was good for a low-cost airline. I felt comfortable at my seat, where my knees didn't touch the back of the front seat. (I'm 188cm tall). Cabin crew were friendly and efficient. All in all, it was a pleasant flight, and good value for money.",

 'text': u'I approached flying easyJet with some reservations. My last budget airline, a certain blue and yellow operator operating from Stansted put me off - almost for life. As I was only in Milan for 24 hours, the BA Club Europe fare, the worst regional business class in the world, was a staggering \xa3900 return. So I settled for easyJet at \xa3160 - including row "a" seats on both flights. I was very pleased I did. The 1st flight left an hour late due to a bizarre "technical" issue. A wheelchair in the hold was found to have non detachable lithium batteries. The captain had to cross check the legality and in the end the passenger and wheelchair was deplaned. On both flights, the crew were very personable and friendly. Greeted everyone on board with a smile and "welcome aboard". On the return the captain did likewise. I found the seat comfortable. The plane well turned out. The return flight left on time and arrived early. Had a gin and tonic on the way back which was fairly priced. All in all a very good experience and I would not hesitate to recommend.',

Everyone got on the flight with massive bags that were obviously not fit to be carried on and then had to remove the luggage from the plane. Another thing that is annoying is the non-existant entertainment system. We had a family infront of us that had ipads and laptops with them. All you have is a magazine with pictures of things you can buy, and not to mention that everything on board from foods to drinks will cost you money. There are however, meal deals where you pay 6 euros and you get a bacon sandwich, a drink, and a bag of chips. All in all just like someone else said, it will get you from point A to point B, but only if the low price is worth sacrificing food, comfort and entertainment.",

On reaching Hurghada the captain was forced to divert to Luxor due the runway being closed due to debris. We re-fuelled at Luxor and flew back to Hurghada, and crew dealt with this in a professional and understanding way. Concerning seats on the A320, outbound we had the 'old' seats, and on the return flight we had the new seats. We were able to make direct comparison. Our verdict is that the new seats offer more legroom and are more stable and comfortable. I was relieved to see that the seats do not recline, a big reason that we select EasyJet. One criticism is that on the return flight the cabin crew had run out of food (rolls, baguettes, etc) by the time they reached us. We were told that this is a frequent thing. I noted that they had plenty of duty free perfumes and goods to sell. I would suggest more food is loaded at Gatwick and less perfumes etc.",

I have avoided it this long but it was inevitable this time around as I wasn't paying for the trip myself so I had budget constrain. Flew from London Gatwick to Lisbon. Let's start with the booking process. This was easy and straightforward, living up to its name. However, the additional charges for bags and seats (although I knew about it) still irked me. It really should be standard. How can any airline charge their customers for choosing where to sit? Afterall, we are already paying to fly. The bags - less said. Anyway, the London Gatwick experience was so-so. If you're not an easyJet Plus customer you can't bring anything else apart from one cabin bag-not even a small handbag. I think this is just ridiculous. A handbag is like a 5th limb for most people. Having said that, when returning, the staff at the boarding gate in Lisbon terminal 2 (budget airlines only terminal), allowed the passenger in front of me to carry her handbag which was almost as big as her cabin bag. She wasn't an easyJet Plus customer as those who were went through another lane. She was told to queue like we all were. This inconsistency is what lets easyJet down. I have to say, their pilots on both leg of the journey were brilliant. High winds, but not a bump when landing. The bag drop process in Gatwick was smooth. The one in Lisbon was so-so (might have to do with it being a budget terminal). Calling you to the gate 45 minutes before departure and then to go through passport control was a very silly set-up. It meant everyone was anxious and rushing and in a bad mood. But that's the termnal's fault. Easyjet - if I have the means, I would never fly it. The only other airline worst than easyjet is Ryanair (which I flew with once 20 years ago and never again).",

I queued up very early (only a few passengers in front of me) to ensure I got onboard fastly and I could put my bag in. When I reached the door of the plane the ground staff tried to snatch the bag from me but I asked why as the overhead lockers were empty - I explained I was going straight to a wedding reception and that my dress was at the top of my case ironed and ready to put on and this is why I had a seat and the front of the plane and queued early - they were kind and understood and told me to speak to the crew. I then encountered a very smug crew who didn\'t want to know about my need or wouldn\'t explain why my bag was being offloaded when it was still empty - he said it was a full flight but surely it\'s first come first served for baggage space? To which he sang with a big smile on his face "you have agreed to the terms and conditions when you bought the ticket, so if you don\'t like it please leave!" I was in shock of this and had to ask again to make sure I heard right - asking me to leave because I had asked why I couldn\'t put it there when it was empty - absolutely no empathy or warmth and seemed to take pleasure from it and made eyes with another crew. He then instructed them to remove my bag and wasn\'t asked if I needed to take anything from it - I later realised I was left without money or my motion sickness medication and didn\'t feel comfortable to ask if my bag could be retrieved due to the unapproachable crew - this made the flight miserable. The captain did make a PA to apologise for offloaded bags after landing which was professional, so was it too much for the crew to use his discretion and be human or atleast apologise for the situation also?!',

Staff excellent, communication excellent the only (slight) problems were waiting for 15mins on the bus to board the plane - it had to be cleaned after the incoming flight and a shortage of refreshment both probably due to the incoming flight.',

 'text': u'Flew out on the 21st from London Gatwick to Montpellier with easyJet - a few of us flew out for a rugby game. My companion and I had booked separately and I had selected seats and chose to take cabin baggage only. Both our bags were hard cases of less than regulation size. We arrived at the gate to be told that our bags would have to be checked in (no charge) a bit annoying but not really a problem. We took our seats having noticed the lockers crammed full with cases which in no way were regulation size or less. Again annoying but not worth making a fuss over. Then, we were informed that due to the baggage conveyor going wrong, all the hold bags had to be moved manually so a delay was inevitable. This is when the hard seat with my knees under my chin became an issue. For the 1.5 hour flight I was prepared to suffer but the extra hour made it a bit torturous. Coming back on the 25th, the flight was overbooked and again, people were asked to put luggage in the hold. We kept our cases as I suspect the reclaim at Gatwick would have been a much longer wait than at Montpellier which was very quick. The queuing system at the gate was a bit farcical and disorderly. Because we had no priority boarding, it was difficult to find anywhere for our cases due again, in no uncertain way to the lockers being overstuffed with oversize luggage. The cabin staff were very helpful and fitted our bags in further down the cabin. I felt sorry for the staff having to put up with quite a few unpleasant comments from other travellers. As the price was quite cheap, I would use Easyjet again but I think their cabin baggage policy needs to be stricter as people will always try to break the rules.',

 'text': u'During my recent flight from Spain, where I live, to Gatwick for the weekend I experienced appalling treatment at the hands of Easyjet staff. As we were about to board the plane we were asked to demonstrate that our bag would fit in the cage. This was an irritating request seeing as we had flown with the bag a dozen times, but nonetheless one I acceded to in good humour, courtesy and without protest. In the interests of saving time I placed the bag in the cage, but did not push it all the way down. The first two wheels glided in seamlessly, but the last two wheels were left protruding out of the cage by about 1 inch, but only as I had not pushed the bag down as it should have been obvious it fitted. The Easyjet employee simply stated "right, it doesn\u2019t fit it will have to be checked in". There was no attempt to be helpful and suggest I get the last two wheels in and no application of common sense that dictated that if the first two wheels fitted, then the last two logically also must. It was not said with even a modicum of courtesy and she walked away from me while she was talking. I went back to the desk where she rudely informed me I had to pay \xa345 for it to be checked in. Understandably shocked and frustrated at my appalling public treatment I refused, to which she replied "well you won\u2019t be flying then". I was utterly flabbergasted at how brusquely I was being spoken to. At this point she directed me, again curtly, to her manager. Her manager displayed a similar lack of professionalism and contempt for us, talking to me as though I were an errant child that should have known better. I pointed out that we had flown out on Friday with the bag, to which she responded that she didn\u2019t know if I really did as I may have checked it in, the logical inference being I was lying. I pointed out that she could look up my flight records and see that I had not checked in any luggage, to which she responded that I might have swapped the bag while in the UK over the weekend. The stupidity of this statement needs no explanation. She reiterated that I would not be flying if we refused to pay. I suggested there was an issue with Easyjet staff training seeing as I had flown with the bag a dozen times and never experienced any problems, to which she contemptuously explained to me that her staff were excellently trained in these matters. At this point both my girlfriend and I were exhausted with the ridiculousness of it all. My girlfriend offered to demonstrate to the manager that the bag did fit, which the manager flippantly accepted, clearly certain that her "well trained" staff couldn\u2019t possibly have made an error. The bag went all the way into the cage and the manager\u2019s response was simply "ok, yes it can go in with you". We received no apology. She simply walked off and carried on with her work. I even had to ask for our passports back. I would also like to point out that on the flight out we were told there was no room in the overhead bins (there was) and we had to check it in. Perhaps I should have charged Easyjet \xa345 for doing so. Is this really the level of professionalism and customer service I can expect from Easyjet? This is easily the most appalling treatment I have received as a customer. I will make every effort, even at personal expense and inconvenience, to fly with other airlines.',

 'text': u'Liverpool to Palma return. Outward journey was fine: prompt departure, uneventful flight, efficient - if slightly low key - cabin crew, slightly early arrival. Return journey was delayed because the original incoming aircraft had had to be replaced, but easyJet did what it could to keep us informed. An agent came and waited at the gate for an hour or so to tell passengers of the delay and to provide updates, only leaving when the first of the proper boarding staff arrived. She had actually ended up trying to field more inquiries from passengers waiting at the next gate for a delayed shared Heathrow flight than from easyJet customers. From the time the plane finally arrived, boarding was very swiftly organised and completed in less than half an hour. The flight itself was uneventful and we made up a little time en route, eventually arriving about 90 minutes late. At no time had there been any significant fuss or complaint about the delay, probably because an effort was made to keep us informed.',

However, on this occasion I think the attitude of the young man in charge of the cabin left a lot to be desired. We were sitting in an aisle and middle seat on row two, Once everyone was on board, I noticed none of the front row seats were occupied so I asked if we could move forward one row to allow my wife to have a window seat. The young man said no because we would have to pay an "upfront fee" to do so. However, we already had easyJet plus because we had reserved row two seats. Okay, he was sticking strictly to the rules but it seemed a bit mean when no-one else was sitting there. However, there was no excuse for this easyJet flight attendant actually shouting from his seat at a passenger sitting behind me. There appeared to be some confusion over whether the passenger was using a child seatbelt properly. At this stage the aircraft was still above the clouds, the undercarriage had not been lowered and the pilot had not given cabin crew the warning that landing was imminent. There was therefore no reason why he could not have left his seat and spoken to the passenger in a polite manner. Instead, he yelled: "Excuse me Sir" at the top of his voice before the young lady sitting beside him nudged him and pointed out the seatbelt was, in fact, properly activated. There was no apology. They simply resumed their conversation about Christmas gifts they had received.',

 'text': u"Lyon to Bristol. We were a family of 8. Ranging from 6 - 70 years old. My 70 year old father hurt his knee whilst we were away so was walking with crutches. When we arrived at the airport we asked for a wheelchair it never arrived. He walked from terminal 1-3. We queued to book in, again asked for a wheelchair. They told my parents to sit and wait and a wheelchair would arrive. They told us the rest of our group had to carry on through passport control leaving my father with my mother to wait for the chair. They never checked on them to see and the wheelchair never arrived. My dad then had to walk through security and a 15 min walk to the boarding area.  When they arrived in the boarding lounge they told us what had happened. Dad sat down on one of the chairs and a staff tripped over his bad leg. She only turned around when my mum lept to try and cover his bad leg. She didn't stop to see if he was okay. I asked another staff if he could have assistance from the boarding lounge to the plane - she said she had to see his boarding pass, checked it and said it's not written on his boarding pass. She begrudgingly let him go to the front of the queue. A very disappointing journey that could have easily been different if any of the staff had taken time to deal with the situation properly. To say we are angry at the level of customer service provided by easy jet would be an understatement!",

 'text': u'The drive to Bristol was good, the parking was good, the bag drop "plus" was quick, efficient and friendly, fast track through security was good as was priority boarding. Then it all turned pear shaped. The Captain told us there would be a maximum delay of 1hr 10mins because of computer issues at Brest air traffic control. We finally set off 1.5 hrs later with no further warnings or explanations. We had paid for extra leg room seats, but were not warned that for the person sitting nearest the window in row 1 (the only extra leg room seats) was limited by the slide stowage, so it was only okay if you had no left leg! The seats were like church pews, upright and uncomfortable and to add to our misery they did not recline even one notch! This despite the stewardess telling us at each take off and landing that we must ensure our seats are upright! After about 1.5hrs the feeling in our legs was replaced by the pain of biting cold. We were told no blankets could be supplied because it is a budget airline and people steal them and anyway we should know and bring our own. Cabin service was curt to the point of rudeness, rather than efficient. The descent into Funchal was extremely turbulent we experienced a "missed approach" due to the cross winds being outside the aircraft\'s limits. We briefly joined a holding pattern, but were diverted to Gran Canaria. We were later told this was because there was insufficient fuel to wait and make a second attempt. As it was now nearly six hours since we last ate, we asked for some food. We were told they could not serve hot food now and anyway all the food would have gone off and not be fit to eat! Instead they handed out complementary pringles/crisps and plastic cups of water! After at least an hour, the pilot decided to return to Funchal make another attempt to land. If that failed he would take us to "mainland Europe." The descent was much smoother and the landing was achieved. We finally landed 5 hrs after our allotted time at 12.20am! It was a relief to disembark after 9hrs on the aircraft. Fortunately, our car hire had stayed open for our flight, so we were able to get ourselves to a hotel and find a room for the night, as it was now too late to pick up the key to the apartment we were renting. We have since discovered that earlier flights by other airlines took their passengers to other islands and paid for overnight accommodation. Easyjet made no attempt to even make sure we were able to find and get to accommodation at that late hour - there being no taxis at the airport! Whilst the circumstances were not all the fault of Easyjet, and, indeed, we had expected problems with the landing, this airline made a bad situation many times worse by their appalling attitude and shoddy service. Suffice it to say we are not looking forward to the return journey, after which we would never travel with them again!',

For example a group in front of me were requested to pack their hand bags into their wheelie bags as they were allowed only one piece on board. Speedy Boarding was honoured and well policed with other passengers being politely asked to wait when they tried to board. However we then had to wait 5-10 minutes standing on the airbridge until we were allowed on board. Onboard I had no problem getting my bags up in the locker near me. This aircraft had the new seating and the legroom in this exit row seat was superb. The crew were very friendly and professional. My only criticism was that on a flight duration of 4h 30 mins they could easily have done more than two runs with the food and drinks trolley service. I would have bought another drink if they had! We departed early and arrived early and disembarkation was swift. Unfortunately progress through passport control was slow as there were only two immigration officers on duty in Paphos. This was my first experience of Easyjet and I'd fly with them again.",

Apart from one significant delay in Corfu because of weather, we have never had any problems with any of our flights. The existence of easyJet (and to a lesser extent, Ryanair) has allowed us to travel frequently and cheaply, which would have been impossible 20 years ago, so thank you for that, easyJet. Yes, one can be picky and identify minor irritations at times, e.g. on this latest flight to Malaga we were marginally late leaving Liverpool because boarding was delayed despite this being the plane's first flight of the day. Such gripes are trivial, however, in comparison with the efficient and good-humoured service provided by all the easyJet staff we have encountered over the years. The slightly tardy departure apart, this flight more than lived up to the usual standard, with a bonus of an anniversary token for everyone on board.",

I had several other tries but each time the internet site told me to check in at the airport. There, they told me that my flight was over-booked (this seems to be a common policy of easyJet and often, there are enough people who do not come). Well of course, this time not. There was only one easyJet employee (who was totally over-charged with workload) at the customer service who told me to wait briefly. The queue of people became longer and longer (there seems to be lots of queries and complaints with easyJet) and I ended up waiting several hours. Ironically, easyJet writes on their boarding passes "don\'t be late the others can\'t wait" (yeah right, and I can?) and "next time, why not check-in online" (well I tried to but their site wouldn\'t let me).

However my most recent experience, a return journey between Gatwick and Edinburgh, left a bad taste in my mouth regarding boarding. At LGW, one check-in assistant was telling all women they couldn't take both a handbag and a trolleybag into the cabin, causing a scrum at the gate while dozens of female passengers frantically tried to squash their bags inside their suitcases. The other check-in assistant wasn't remotely bothered however, and as I was in her queue, I sailed through with both my bag and case. Having a bit of time to kill at EDI coming back, I noticed that easyJet have a strange policy of asking passengers on almost every departing flight to volunteer to put their cabin baggage into the hold. Towards the end of the boarding queue, this no longer becomes voluntary, as happened to my two travelling companions who were told their bags would be tagged and taken away from them on the tarmac. This is infuriating if you have had liquids confiscated at security, for example, or have a tight onward connection to make. If the aircraft isn't big enough to accommodate hand luggage for every passenger then easyJet need to revise their policy, making checked luggage much more affordable (or free) rather than wasting boarding time by taking people's bags off them. Overall I do like easyJet but their boarding procedures are becoming inconsistent and a tad shambolic.",

 'text': u'First thing easyjet need to address is their staff need some training in customer service, what a miserable, sullen and in some cases rude bunch of people thats from check in staff through to cabin crew, rude and ill mannered. There was an odd one or two and I mean two max who were bordering on half pleasant. Flight was delayed but we were still herded onto the plane and sat there with a 4 hr delay, we were eventually maybe after 3hr and 45 minutes offered a plastic cup half full of water which you had to go to the back of the plane for. Granted - mid air we were offered a drink and pringles or a chocolate bar, but you would have thought the cabin crew were paying for this out of their own pocket. It was begrudged. I would say nearly all if not all passengers were from the north west, and even though we were cooped up, passengers were annoyed and fed up, but there was still a good banter amongst the passengers. Easyjet take note you could have had a lot of irate, angry passengers to deal with and quite rightly so.',

I have never been to Bristol airport and asked at the easyJet desk where I needed to go (myself and family already had 'speedy boarding cards') - the assistant on the desk spoke to me like I was something she had trod in saying in a cold manner 'You don't need to be here, you don't have luggage do you? , just go up the stairs over there'. So I went to the Aspire Lounge until the TV screen showed which Gate I needed to be at to board my flight home. When the screens did show me where my gate was, the time was 15.45 at gate 15,  so we made our way towards the gate. I happened to spot a sign on a wall that said it was a seven minute walk from this sign to gate 15.  Whilst walking down the corridor I was watching the info screens and noticed that gate 15 had changed from 'boarding' to 'closing' - the time on the screen was 15.51. Everyone on that now started to run down the corridor in fear that they would not make the flight. My elderly parents were flying with me and my mother is asthmatic so she cannot run or even walk quickly. How is anyone supposed to make a flight when they are not given enough time to comfortably walk a route. Everyone was complaining about this and the staff just shrugged their shoulders and said in a muttered tone 'You got here didn't you?'. That is not the attitude I expect from a professional company. This was my first experience of an easyJet flight and it will also be my last. My advice to Bristol easyJet staff is to remember your customers pay your wages, treat them with respect and have a friendly attitude.  My overall rating is 5/10 and the 5 is for the staff at the Newcastle, Bristol easyJet staff get nothing.",

I have called them since my return 5 times (the average hold time is over 30 minutes) and although they promise to sort this out and say a manager will call back, they lie - they don't sort it out and don't call back. As a travel editor I regularly use low cost airlines - Jet2, Ryanair etc. and I have to say the lack of customer service make easyJet the worst I have come across.

The staff doing that told us to hurry as she was about to go off shift and we would have had to wait for her replacement to arrive! Next morning we did just breeze through however. We were in the South terminal. What a horrible terminal. The only upside was we had a gate were we actually boarded using a plane bridge instead of the stairs! Onboard the crew were very nice and the plane clean and tidy. I find their on board menu options overpriced and they never seem to have the items I want anyway! The flight to Paphos is over 4 hours and easyJet seats don\'t recline (even though they tell you make sure your seat is in the upright position) and there is no head rest support. easyJet planes are like sitting on a park bench. Nice for a little while, but eventually you want to move on. But you can\'t. The whole plane got fidgety because they were so uncomfortable.

The return flight was even worse. They kept delaying the flight and delaying the flight, then cancelled after midnight. The blamed it on the weather so they didn't have to pay hotels. There was only a light shower at around 6pm and all the other airlines were departing except for easyJet. The customer service is horrible. No one cares about how delayed you are. We were stranded in Rome because all the flights out were booked. I ended up having to book another airline to get out of there. They were not apologetic for the huge inconvenience.

During the flight I noticed that the crew were there for your safety and nothing else. All of the crew were French so asking for anything might have been a challenge. Every announcement was in French and then (with difficulty) translated into English. I was a bit surprised considering it's an english airline but maybe these flights are run by another division of the airline to suit the majority of the passengers on board. Overall I was impressed by their 'no frills' service and would recommend flying with Easyjet on their short european routes.",

It takes longer to get from the Gatwick runway to the terminal exits than it does to fly from Aberdeen to Gatwick. There is always a palava getting off, no steps, no chocks. Too windy.

 'text': u'Opted for easyJet as the price was half my preferred airport and airline option. Even with the travel time and train or car park extras it was worth the saving. Hand bags only, so nothing to check in, but it wouldn\'t have been a problem as there were so few people at the check in desks. Southend Airport only has around 20 flights a day so it wasn\'t crowded except when we queued for our flight. Boarding was slow as they made most people check that their bag fitted in the measuring device. Onboard you could see why as there wasn\'t much space for bags if you were late. We were two thirds of the way in the queue and just managed to get our bags in, but some rows from the seats. I wish we\'d been with our bags further up as we had parents with a toddler behind us that kept kicking the seat, putting it\'s hands through the gap etc. I know this wasn\'t easyJet\'s fault, but glad it was only a short flight. Despite the short length, the seats are still hard and lack neck support. So glad to get off at the end. At Amsterdam it was a new experience using the "G" gates. These are low cost I assume as we had to up and down stairs in the terminal as well as from the plane Coming back we got to the gate earlyish so we were in the queue to get onboard quickly and got our bags above our seats. Prompt loading and good to see the crew helping load bags to get the flight away on time. Looong taxi to the runway. Took 10 mins to pass the "regular" D gates BA/KLM use for UK flights. However departure was ontime and with flying time of 35 mins back to Southend, can\'t complain. Off the plane and through immigration in about 10 mins. Easyjet offer a bus service in the air, a no frills trip. It\'s fine as it got us from A to B and back again but could improve the comfort of it\'s seats. The seats are the only thing you will have interaction with if you don\'t check in a bag or buy some of the overpriced on board food, so it would do them a world of good to improve the comfort of them.',

On the last leg of our honeymoon, my husband and decided to book Easyjet because it was cheaper than other airlines for an hour and a half flight. Big mistake. We got to the airport at 10.45 am for our 1.20 pm flight. Right away they notified us at the baggage drop that our flight was delayed two hours due to a "technical difficulty." About an hour before the delayed flight time, we were notified at the gate that the flight was delayed another two hours due to a "technical difficulty." We went downstairs to customer service to discuss our options. The representative was hostile and extremely rude, telling us that the only option was to wait. We wasted the entire day at the airport and will miss all of our reservations. The best part is today is my husband\'s birthday. In fairness, I know all airlines experience technical difficulties from time to time, but it seems much more frequent of an issue with Easyjet (see Easyjet reviews). Spend a little more and book with a reputable airline to avoid spending a full day of your precious vacation at the airport.',

However, the woman on the check in desk did not mention that the surchage of \xa332 did not include bringing the bag back. Had she said this then I would have taken the bag back to my car which was in Silver Zone (we had arrived 2.5 hours early). I was shocked at Geneva when I was asked to pay another 50 Swiss francs. The supervisor for was rude and his reply was "well I\'m not Bristol airport". I\'ve complained to easyJet and asked them to refund half of the \xa364 surcharge but they have refused simply saying that correct charges were applied. Yes, I know they were the correct prices but I would have expected a more professional and helpful approach at Bristol from the easyJet  check in desk. At least then I could have the choice to leave the extra bag behind.',

I could forgive one such problem; two strikes me as that there may be grounds to operational management issues at this airline. It seems to me that EasyJet does not have the capability to operate its program at the rate it is trying to do. Particularly for short flights with rapid turnaround. My advice to passengers is fly early in the day. Late on they will have encountered problems and you will have no idea what time you will travel.',

I had already paid almost \xa3600 for the 3 seats and since minors can\'t travel alone I assumed one of us would be seated with him. It was obviously something I hadn\'t even thought of an in hindsight, even though I shouldn\'t have to pay even more it would have been the safer option, however my complaint is with the way it was dealt with by the cabin crew and the distinct lack of customer care.

 'text': u"I am pleased to say Easyjet performed well for the busy summer season for our flights to and from La Rochelle to visit family. We didn't have bags but did get to the airport very early. Outbound: EZY8995, 14.40 (15.30)-17.05 (17.37), July 28th. Once in the departure lounge a 12 min delay was posted with the inbound aircraft 30 mins late. Around 30 mins before scheduled time of departure we got told to go to gate 52. Boarding was predominately hassle free but people could just walk on the plane. We pushed back at 15.00 and left Gatwick at 15.30 which was 50 mins late. The cabin crew were friendly and did apologise a few times for the delay. The food was quite expensive but still not as bad as Ryanair. We landed at 17.37 and deboarding was done quickly. The delay was acceptable as it was the 3rd return flight of the day in the summer. Inbound: EZY8996, 12.35( 13.25)-12.50 (13.20), August 5th. Once in the departure lounge a 25 min delay was posted. We boarded quickly around 10 mins after the aircraft arrived and were off quickly and on time. We were advised a flying time of 50 mins which is extremely quick in comparison to the average duration therefore service was rushed. However it was good to catch up with the delay. All in all the easy jet service was normal and the delays were bearable for the peak summer season. Flights costs \xa395 per person with row 7 seats pre-booked.",

It was bumpy, but not too distressing, and I always think it is a good thing to be informed before departure - forewarned is forearmed. Did not try catering as did not enjoy it on outward leg. We opted instead to purchase something at Malaga Airport. Good hardworking crew, good announcements and info en route. Another nod in the direction of BA, charity collection and Captain saying goodbye to disembarking passengers. Next easyJet flight for me will be next week to Inverness.',

This is the first time I have flown easyJet in a number of years, and I am glad to report that they have upped their game. No more silly announcements about placing your unwanted children in overhead lockers, or smokers will be evicted mid-air. They were professional, and hard working. Good announcements from flight deck and crew. They seem to have adopted some of BA practices, such as collection for charity (Unicef) and Captain waiting to say goodbye to disembarking passengers. Only downside, I could not recommend the bacon baguette, and my wife could not recommend the ham and cheese toastie. Overall good experience.',

Rows are now slightly staggered. Presumably new seating has allowed an extra few seats to be fitted and are clearly much lighter than older, more comfortable seats. The design of the seats does not allow anyone in seats other than aisle to see the safety demonstration. I am 6 ft tall and really struggled to watch demonstration and knees reached seat base in front. Have flown many times on Easyjet over many years but this was one of the most uncomfortable and is clearly a retrograde step in my opinion.',

 'text': u"Overall a good value for money experience with EasyJet. Was flying from Luton Airport to Nice on a Sunday morning. Upon arrival at the airport, as check in now happens online it was easy to just queue up and drop the bags off at the bag drop desks. Though it's not favourable having so many flights queueing up for around 8 desks the queues were not that bad and the airline were beginning to open more desks. Worst thing about this bag drop system is that those running late don't have an individual desk so have to queue up for a while or use flight closures. The next step of the journey involving the airline was boarding. This happened efficiently and despite the flight being full speedy boarding wasn't needed as overhead locker space was easily avaliable when on board. The cabin crew (4) were helpful, friendly and very presentable. The leg room and seat comfort was as expected. As only a short flight there was no need to purchase any snacks or drinks but as with most airlines items were a touch pricey but there was a decent selection. Our flight was delayed by 40 minutes leaving Luton due to a wait for a take off slot from ATC this delay did seem longer as the aircraft was boarded by 0650 and didn't take off till 0750. Not expected but would of been nice to have screens to follow the route and the captain/first officer gave very little updates. Despite the delay leaving due to a tail wind we did only arrive 15 minutes late. Baggage was delivered in Nice T2 around 15 minutes after disembarking the aircraft which was very speedy. Good experience with EasyJet would advise booking early for cheaper flights but if your able to be flexible that also helps. Overall good experince with EasyJet and looking forward to our return journey with the airline.",

Having been marshalled at the gate, (with seating for only 15 people travelling in Plus, and no seating for Economy), it is just a short walk to the aircraft for boarding, which goes smoothly as both front and rear doors are used. In bad weather this exposure could be slightly unpleasant, as bottle-necks would mean waiting on the aircraft steps. However, all is good on board. The cabin is clean and tidy, the flight staff good humoured, and the blessing of a non-reclining seat-back so that the passenger in front of you cannot recline their seat as soon as possible, and perhaps leave it in that position for the whole of the flight \u2013  wonderful. BRS to CPH. Bag drop opened 3 hours before the flight time which is a boon. The inbound aircraft was slightly late, and therefore we could witness the arrival passengers struggle across the tarmac against heavy rain in their scanty holiday clothes. Luckily we had our travel umbrellas as, in addition, we were held up on the aircraft steps for a minute or two. Again, a cheerful crew who dealt with their cabin duties in a professonal manner. The captain made up for the late start, and we arrived on time in Copenhagen.',

 'text': u"Flight out (Manchester to Heraklion) was fine, pleasant staff and straight forward. We checked bags and carried hand luggage. Cramped and uncomfortable seating, along with expensive food on board, this unfortunately becoming the norm for this level of airline, so no surprises. Returning (Heraklion to Manchester) however ended with further expense just prior to boarding. We checked the same bag for the hold as before no problem and carried the same bags, but afterwards we received very disorganised information from the easyJet staff at this airport. Waiting to board the plane at the gate we were singled out in the line by an particular easyJet staff member and to some extent made an example off. The issue initially involved my fianc\xe9e carrying an over the shoulder purse as this is apparently one extra piece of hand luggage. I myself had a cabin bag that has an additional over shoulder bag that attaches via a zip. Whilst both bags joined wouldn't fit in the individual persons size limit, the detachable bag is very small and although crammed full fits easily under the seat (as it did on the previous flight no problem). So detached now we had one bag, a small over the shoulder bag and my fianc\xe9e's purse. Both these two smaller items fitted together in the airlines cabin size limit (plus there was more than enough room left for a person to stand next to them). However this particular easyJet member of staff loudly and publicly stated that we had one too may cabin bags. We tried cramming the smaller purse into the other only to have the complaint that the zips were not fully closed. Stressed and feeling victimised at this point with a particularly unfriendly and inflexible staff member, along with feeling singled out, especially as a number of the other customers now going through the gate for boarding next to us carried multiple duty free bags each far larger than our additional 'bag', we were forced to concede to have the cabin bag placed in the aircraft hold to an additional \u20ac55 fee. Great end to a holiday. easyJet for us is not particularly good value for money when you consider the hidden charges (charged to check in online also now I recall), inflexibility and lack of customer service (for at least one particular member of staff). Uncomfortable, no entertainment, limited and lastly not that particular inexpensive flight. We hope to fly with a more reputable airline in the future.",

 'text': u'I don\'t know why they call easyjet a low-cost carrier as the flight was definitely not cheap. Outbound - due to the early departure time I stayed at a Gatwick hotel the night before and used easyjet\'s "midnight check-in" which meant the next morning I avoided the queues and went straight to security. I\'d paid for a seat up front and had speedy boarding both ways. Despite it being a holiday destination, I didn\'t find the overheads filling up too much. Very nice crew on both legs. Outbound we were pushed back and told we\'d be delayed an hour. Last time I flew this route with easy we were delayed 3 hours. This is crucial to me as I had a ferry to catch once we got to Kefalonia and last time I had to pay \u20ac100 for a private water taxi instead. With the delay and the non-reclining seats, my back was beginning to ache, probably not helped sitting next to a wide muscle man. Coming back we had a newer plane with thinner seats and bigger gaps between them. I\'ve had bus seats more comfortable. On the plus side I had 2 seats next to me spare which has been very rare from me. This flight was delayed coming to Kefalonia and landing at Gatwick we were held up for about 20 mins. Bags took a while to come out. Overall, a satisfactory journey, but they need to drop the "low-cost" moniker and go back to being called a no frills airline as that\'s what it is with all the charges you pay.',

We could have bought the two rollerbags a seat on the plane for half that amount of money. After tagging our bags, the agents did not seem to be able to figure out how to charge us so they told us to give our bags to the luggage handler at the bottom of the airplane steps and get on the flight, which we were holding up at that point.

I paid $12 extra for extra leg room so our carry on bags would be guaranteed to fit, as we weren't checking luggage. We both fell asleep promptly and missed any drink service or entertainment.

We have seen this before at Madeira airport and it makes for a poor end to a nice holiday. Easyjet need to review their arrangements at this airport. The flight itself was uneventful on an older A320, left early and arrived early. The only slight disappointment was that there was only one refreshment run. Since they had run out of most snacks early on the first run perhaps they thought it wasn't worth doing a second (although a drink of some kind would have been welcome).

The cabin crew on this flight from Bristol were especially nice and were really good with children, which was nice as I was travelling with my two young nephews. I didn't bother with anything from the in-flight service so can't comment on that. My seat was fine as well, although the seating generally looked like it could do with a bit of refurb soon. But overall I was really pleased with the service on this very short hop from Bristol to Bordeaux.",

 'text': u'My return flight to the UK from Bordeaux was not as good as going out. Largely due to the chaotic nature of Bordeaux airport. This involved a cattle like holding area for passengers waiting to board the flight. We were held there for ages before being allowed onto the plane and it was really uncomfortable with nowhere to sit and a single file queueing area in place. Once onboard the flight was very busy. The cabin crew did a good job really, especially as there were one or two disruptive passengers on board who were pretty rude to one flight attendant in particular. Other than that, the flight went very quickly. I was going to get something from the in-flight service, having not been able to pick something up at the airport, but it was slow coming round (despite the fact I was only in row 9) so we were making our descent by the time they got to me.',

 'text': u'Travelled from Edinburgh to Luton on 30/05/15 and returned on 07/06/15. Being disabled, I requested assistance on both journeys.  The staff at Edinburgh were superb both times,  but the staff at Luton were almost non-existent. On arrival at Luton, we were taken to the baggage hall and told to sit at the side where we would be attended to. I could see my case going round and round and it was eventually removed and taken to me by another passenger. When an attendant eventually arrived, after a very long time, he was rushed off his feet, as there was such a shortage of staff.  On the return journey, I was almost reduced to tears.  I rang from the booth for disabled assistance, and was assured someone would be with me as soon as possible.  I rang twice more and both times was assured someone was on the way. Eventually, a very kind parking attendant went to investigate matters and someone arrived within 10 minutes, by which time I was almost passing out with the heat, as it was like sitting in a greenhouse with the sun beating down and I had waited an hour and a quarter!  Again, the attendant was run off his feet through lack of staff and I had not even been checked in (so much for having to arrive 90 minutes before the flight!).  As it was, the plane was late, otherwise I would have missed my flight.  Having said all that, all staff were very civil, but it did turn my lovely holiday into a nightmare.  If Easyjet are committed to helping disabled people have a smooth journey from start to finish, they need to get their act together and liaise with OES re passenger assistance, especially in this day and age. May I add that the cabin crews were most helpful, as were the OES staff at Edinburgh where the service is most professional.',

 'text': u"Travelled as a couple from London Gatwick to Rome (Fiumicino airport) from Gatwick on Sunday 31st May 2015 and returned to London Gatwick from same airport on Thursday 4th June 2015. Outbound flight: delayed by 1.5 hours due to original Airbus A320 (180 seats) out of action due to technical issues (Easyjet excuse) so eventually transferred to Airbus A319 (only 156 seats). Tight squeeze and confusion for many of where to sit and many family members split. This plane was looking it's age inside and rattled a lot. It was one of the spare ones used specifically for breakdowns. Inbound flight: Delayed by 2 hours. Okay this airport has had a fire but please it was a month ago! Tannoy systems should be fixed by now. This may not be Easyjets fault but consider this: The flight was EZY5260. There was nothing on the electronic screens to show that this flight even existed (despite an Easyjet representative saying that the flight was erased it was never on the boards as we were at the airport for many hours). At the departure terminal 2 there was no information but after several enquiries to airport staff we were asked to go to terminal 3. No information and nobody to consult. There was even a young Easyjet employee who was travelling on an earlier flight (there were several to the UK all delayed) who was as perplexed as we were). At last after further enquiries and looking at the Easyjet website on phones the reason given for the delay was that a technical fault was the excuse. Easyjet are not at fault on the airport issues but I think they could do a lot better. Replacing ageing aircraft is a must and leaving passengers in the dark is inexcusable. Even though the pilot apologized for the delay it's not the delay at all it's the lack of common sense and dialogue that exasperates passengers. I've been in similar positions with other airlines. What do they do? Obtain a large white card describe the problem and where to go and have a rep at the terminal as described. It's not rocket science is it? The marks given are for poor customer relations and not the flight or pilot or flight attendants who were probably as cheesed off as the passengers for working later than anticipated.",

 'text': u'We flew from Inverness to Luton on Wednesday 13/5/15. As usual it was a straightforward flight with no problems. The cabin crew were efficient and polite and because of the short duration of the flight were quite busy. There was a number of disabled passengers including me who required assistance to disembark. Unfortunately the vehicle used for this was busy elsewhere and we had to wait about 10-15 minutes to get off. The Easyjet crew were very apologetic and the Captain herself came back and stayed to chat with us while we waited which I thought was a good bit of customer service. Once in the baggage reclaim area there was another slight delay as the conveyor belt would not start. The attitude of some passengers was appalling. The one airport employee present was constantly badgered about what was happening. All he could say was the engineers were trying to fix it and the duty manager was on his way. This evidently was not good enough for some and they registered their displeasure by behaving in a rude and arrogant fashion to both the one employee present and the duty manager when he arrived. The belt started and all luggage was offloaded and collected after about 30minutes not exactly a catastrophe but to some it was as if Easyjet (who were not responsible for any delay) and the Management at Luton Airport had deliberately conspired to cause a problem for their amusement. People should be more tolerant and if time is truly important perhaps allow time for possible or even probable delays.',

 'text': u"BHX-GVA-BHX. Another great flight with Easyjet. Checked in and printed my boarded passes at home so just had to drop my suitcase at Birmingham which took around 5 minutes. I like that Easyjet now allocate your seats although they still call the flight very early presumably to ensure everyone is at the gate ready for boarding. Our flight departed at 14.55 yet the final call was at 14.15 so there were people hanging around the gate for a while. The flight itself was very smooth with a good selection of food and drinks and we arrived bang on time into GVA. Only gripe is that the in-flight magazine has very little content mostly being adverts and therefore isn't much of a read but for a short flight this isn't really an issue. Baggage was delivered swiftly and I was out of the airport in under 25 minutes. The queues for the bag drop for the return journey were much longer than at BHX I assume that this is because Easyjet only operate three routes from BHX whereas GVA is a hub and therefore there are many more Easyjet flights departing. They utilise the same queue for all flights but if time is tight for a flight they will open a special desk for individual flights. Overall the queue took about 45 minutes to clear which didn't leave any time for shopping as again they put out the final call for the flight a good 40 minutes prior to departure. Return flight was smooth and we landed about 10 minutes ahead of schedule and although the baggage was slower arriving at BHX than GVA I was still out of the airport in under 40 minutes. For the price I paid I cannot complain and I would definitely fly Easyjet again.",

Staff on the outward flight were very polite friendly and helpful but the staff on the return flight (EZY6002 on Thursday 9th April) seemed eager to get the journey over and done with and reluctant to go the extra mile for the passengers. Sandwiches were also sold out by the time the staff came round asking people if they'd like anything to eat and drink.

The experience at the airport was busy and chaotic and ground staff were miserable looking and abrupt with some passengers. Flights on both routes was on time which was good but the cabin staff were poor in their duties and also miserable looking and not very welcoming. I would not use this airline again and would rather pay more for a better experience.',

Usually I just have a carry-on sized suitcase and my handbag which is about the same size as a purse. Although they said that I would need to put my handbag into my suitcase because "only one piece is allowed" but this woman in front of me had several bags from duty free shops which were quite a bit larger than my handbag yet they said nothing about them to her. Additionally I\'m not sure if the seats were not meant to recline or I just couldn\'t find the switch but I ended up not being able to recline the seat on the flight which was fine for a short flight but for further destinations I think this probably wouldn\'t be comfortable.',

It was a traditional 'sardine tin' flight with no leg room and the aisle armrest didn't go up so it was very difficult getting in and out without holding the headrest of the seat in front where a poor young man attempting to sleep was continuously disturbed by me getting up and down as we had a baby with us who wouldn't sit still and it was a 7 30am flight. However the return journey was a total surprise we were on a newer plane with lots of leg room the aisle arm rest went up so we had lots of space and I didn't need to hold onto anything to get in and out of my seat. The seats were a lot thinner but surprisingly more comfortable than the previous thicker seats. On both journeys the planes were on time the staff were friendly- more on the outward flight 2 of the flight attendants on the way back obviously had lost the ability to smile so overall my first experience with easy jet was a positive one and I would definitely use them again. My trip satisfaction would have been a 9 if we had flown both ways on the more comfortable plane and the 2 flight attendants had actually smiled just once!",

Would it hurt that much?

Other regular flyers confirmed this to be the case. The flight was due to leave at 21.25 actually boarded at 23.21 - funnily enough just within the two hour deadline for claiming compensation. No full explanation on their website and I'm afraid the old excuse 'technical issues' just doesn't wash when you overhear other airline staff mention the fact there weren't enough planes to fulfil the bookings promised! By all means fly with easyJet but just do not book the last flight especially on very short flights.",

The check in at Marrakech airport was farcical. We joined a queue with 4 families ahead of us. There was already a woman at the counter who kept arguing with the counter staff for over half an hour. The checking clerk kept disappearing and nothing appeared to be resolved. Then a single-man checked in quickly. He was followed by a large family group who appeared to be completely unable to fill in there own exit cards. The check clerk proceeded to fill in each form for them taking over half an hour! The family then proceeded to tag each piece of luggage with security strips. Our conclusion is you need to arrive 3 hours before the flight in order check in. We were most disappointed.',

 'text': u'Travelled Arrecife to Liverpool 8th January having had a great flight outbound some days earlier ex Manchester with Monarch. The contrast could not be more stark. Boarding passes indicated a boarding time of 18.05 for a 18.35 departure. Approximately an hour before the due time boarding was announced which came as a surprise. An entire planeload of passengers were then processed through the boarding gate only to be left standing in an unlit hot covered walkway for just short of 30 minutes. Whilst my husband and I are able bodied there were any number of elderly passengers and very young children amongst our number who quickly became tired. This was an unpleasant experience but we were staggered to learn from regular passengers on this flight that this is standard prior to departure. From the moment the cabin doors closed pretty much until the wheels touched the tarmac in Liverpool 4 hours 15 minutes later those of us in the rear rows of seats were subjected to an absolute barrage of noise from the staff in the rear galley. During a long evening flight it clearly never occurred to them at any point that their passengers may wish to have some peace in which to rest read or sleep. Even the "trolley service" was conducted in between their gripping chats on many occasions causing them to have to ask passengers to repeat their orders as they clearly hadn\'t listened to them in the first place. We were both glad to finally exit the aircraft and both agreed on walking across the tarmac in highs wind and rain that we would not have had much confidence in this cabin crew to competently handle anything outside gossip and moaning. Will we fly Easyjet again? Trust me never.',

 'text': u'Booked a one day return flight Amsterdam-Gatwick v.v. to attend a funeral on December 12. Whilst in the UK we heard of the computer problems at NATS but were relieved to hear on the way to the airport that problems were solved. Arriving there 3.5 hours before the flight was due we decided to have something to eat. Then a got a message on my iphone: we are very sorry but your flight EZ 8883 has been cancelled. Please contact Easyjet.com etc. This prompted us to go to the Easyjet desk but unfortunately there were already some 200 people before us in long rows with only 2 easyjet employees to assist. Therefore I (fortunately) decided to change my booking online and managed to get a return flight the following day in the evening. Then after 1.5 hours an easyjet employee climbed on a stand and shouted that everybody should see to changing their booking themselves and that accommodation to spend the night had been arranged at the Hilton Hotel. Upon arrival there Hilton knew nothing and was full to the brim. So back to the Easyjet desk only to find out that there were no more rooms but also no more Easyjet employees! Fortunately we managed to find some spare bedrooms in the Block hotel at Gatwick. Even getting a boarding pass proved to be a problem: as I had changed my booking using my iphone I was of course unable to print my boarding pass. So we went to Easyjet in the south terminal and asked them to print the boarding pass. That was not possible we had to go to the North terminal as we would leave from there. After some talking the man behind the desk told us check in was not open yet but after we told him we had already checked in electronically he managed to come up with two traditional boarding passes.',

 'text': u'My gripe is over a flight from Verona to LGW - problems were caused by Italian strikes and on checking in at the airport we were informed that an 11.45 flight had been delayed to 19.15 - not only informed by the check-in lady she also wrote it on our boarding pass and it was showing on the airport screens. She also told us to return to the airport at 1800 hours. We said to the very nice lady (who disappeared about five times as they were obviously being briefed on what to do) that we were going back into town for the day which we did. Due to the delay and a 3 hour drive on return we were looking at booking a hotel for the night at Gatwick but just to check whether we were being told the truth about the 19.15 departure time I decided to check when the rescheduled outward flight was going to leave LGW on the easyjet flight scanner - because it was actually in the air and on further inspection our flight had been rescheduled back to 1250pm - showing on both easyjet and airport websites. Jump into taxi and return to airport. Easyjet (and their agents) must have known at the time we were dropping our bags that the outward flight was actually happening as the plane must have been loaded and on the taxiway at LGW. Also easyjet made no attempt to communicate with us by email or mobile phone. Talking to others on the flight they had been asked at check-in to leave contact details and had been phoned (one family from about 40 miles away had got back home and had to turn around again almost immediately). We were incredibly lucky not to miss the flight.',

 'text': u"I recently booked a trip from London to Jersey for 4 people on easyjet which was a complete mess. One of the passengers arrived separately from the rest of us. He processed to easyjet check-in desk to get a boarding pass and was given the wrong boarding pass by the staff member. He never checked the boarding pass and managed to clear security at the airport with it. When the remanding 3 passengers tried to clear security with our boarding pass this was then it was discovered that the boarding passes were mixed up. This took sometime to be resolved but eventually did. As it was nearly time for our flight to leave we hurried to the gate only to find that is was already closed. At no point during this period did easyjet page us to advise that the gate was closing or that it was the last call for us (the passengers). We had to go back to easyjets desk in the departure area and waited over 45 minutes before someone came to the desk to see us. We had the use the phone on the desk to call an easyjet staff member 7 times before someone arrived. When someone did arrive the matter was not handled with any urgency. We were taken back to customer service desk and were told that it is our responsibility to get to the get to the gate on time. In order to change the ticket we would need to pay. We advised them of the error made my easyjet staff of giving the wrong boarding pass to the wrong passenger. We also asked why we were not paged and was told that easyjet doesn't page customers. They will only do so if you have checked in a bag. We did not check in any bags as we were only going to jersey for a day. I told the agent it was discrimination as easyjet assumes that all passengers are literate. Also it is common practice for airlines to page passengers if they have checked in and not arrived at the gate. We were offered the next easyjet flight which was in the afternoon at nearly 4pm which meant our day trip would not happen. Tried phoning customer service and we were meet with the same no help attitude. In the end we when to jersy and was only able to spend 2 hours. A very unsatisfactory trip. Since then trying to get customer service to take some action has been terrible.",

 'text': u'Friday night flight from Glasgow to London Gatwick. We arrived at 18.00 for the flight as we had to drive in from northern Scotland. Flight was supposed to depart at 21.20 and land at 22.45 after which we would get some sleep in a hotel and fly out to Tenerife at 05.50 the next morning. At check-in we were advised of a delay of 1 hour 38 minutes with no explanation but the agent told us to keep watching the board as easyJet would try to push the flight forward. The opposite happened. Our scheduled departure time went past 23.00 00.00 and 01.00. Eventually a fellow passenger told us that refreshment vouchers were being handed out at the gate but no announcements were being made to that effect. Staff at the airport were visibly annoyed at the situation. There were no easyJet representatives to speak to only gate staff. When they finally did appear they told us that the delay to the inbound flight was due to severe thunderstorms in Gatwick earlier on in the day but every flight before and after it had already left Gatwick so clearly something else was wrong. They eventually told us that the aircraft was now fully boarded in Gatwick and was awaiting one more crew member they would inform us of its departure. The aircraft landed at 01.50 and we were called forward for boarding immediately leaving us standing for 10 minutes - not what we wanted having been awake since 05.00 the previous morning. Boarded just after 02.00 and took off at 02.25. The captain explained that the delay was due to thunderstorms but in addition the aircraft had technical problems forcing a replacement aircraft to be found and a new crew also had to be sourced. We were in the last row of the aircraft which had no window and was cramped due to the tapering in of the fuselage at the rear. This in addition to the annoying racket the cabin crew were making in the galley made sleep almost impossible. It was 03.45 by the time we disembarked in Gatwick check in for our next flight was already open. To our horror the aircraft parked at the South terminal (replacement aircraft had next flight from there) meaning that passengers and baggage had to be taken over to the North terminal where the flight was destined. Fortunately baggage arrived quickly which was a huge relief because we had to change back to the South terminal in time for our next flight where we finally arrived absolutely exhausted at 04.15. To top it all off easyJet sent us an email saying that the delay was due to adverse weather alone and so we are not entitled to compensation.',

 'text': u"Have travelled several times with easyJet and continue to be very satisfied with the service provided. Crews work hard are helpful and informative and we never feel hassled. Particularly worthy of mention is the assistance my wife received on our recent flight to Malaga - she thought she had mislaid her passport when she reached passport control and rushed back to the plane before boarding began for its return journey. The crew were both sympathetic and helpful especially the Spanish boarding agent. When they couldn't find it she knew it had to be on her person somewhere and it was. The only niggles that I have relate to the seats on their newer aircraft and the way in which they release their future flight schedules. We came back from Mallorca in September on a new A320 with slimline seats which lack the padding and comfort of the older style ones. As for the flight schedules separate releases for Spring early Summer late Summer have resulted in us twice settling for flights in 2015 with Ryanair instead of waiting for easyJet to release its next tranche. We would find it much more convenient if the whole of the Spring and Summer flights were published at the same time and easyJet would be less likely to lose our custom.",

Return flight also excellent with a good crew but information in main lounge was poor regarding gate and boarding. Without doubt the 'new' arrangements regarding allocated seating has made the experience that more civilised when boarding. My only issue is the poor choice of food on board and the exorbitant prices for tea and coffee. That aside easyjet really are ahead of other short haul airlines.",

 'text': u'We flew from London Gatwick airport to Antalya Turkey in September 2014. What a mess! When we arrived at the bag drop there were two long queues moving rather slowly. EasyJet staff was running madly around the queues calling out for the passengers of the flights that are about to depart. These passengers (us among them) were then moved from inside the general queues to the fast track queue. The bag drop person informed us that the flight was delayed by 1 hour (this information never appeared on the airport display). We figured we had enough time to have a quick lunch. While waiting for our food I went to the information booth to double-check where the lady told me that our flight is not really being delayed all that much maybe by 1/2 hour or less - still no update on any of the airport displays. We quickly bagged our lunch and rushed to the gate. There was still no plane at the gate. Eventually it arrived late (the airport display still had the original departure time no update) and the boarding began. What a mess! After the initial boarding call for privileged EasyJet loyalty program members general boarding call was announced without any regard to the row numbers (i.e. everyone entered in random order) - but the airplane door was closed for some reason so after standing for a while in the line many people went back to the waiting area. Finally the door was open and everyone went inside the plane. Because the boarding order was not related in any way to the location of the people inside the aircraft (normally the rear rows board first to avoid congestion) chaos inside the aircraft followed and the boarding itself took a long time. The flight itself was uneventful no problems upon arrival luggage was offloaded quickly. If this airline can introduce some order into its operational activities I will be happy to use its services again. Also our flight may have been an exception - I do realize that one should not generalize based on a single flight experience.',

Yes I know Easyjet have a one bag policy which we knew about before we flew but please tell me why Easyjet requires customers to take the hat out of a see-through bag and put it on rather than employ common sense. I suppose we must wait for Easyjet to adopt the same cabin baggage policy that Ryanair has been forced to adopt (ie. you are allowed a personal item). Previously we have ranked Easyjet higher than Ryanair. After two recent flights with Ryanair over the last couple of months I think we will now stick with Ryanair and avoid Easyjet.

We followed the rules about bag dimensions and weights and checked in 1 bag each and proceeded to the holding area. Finally a call that our flight was boarding and an extended stampede of passengers to Gate 25 only to find we were further held before boarding. Here we were met with a very unfriendly ground staff member telling us that we were only allowed 1 bag not 2 as we were carrying (1 x wheelie + 1 x accessories). Having checked with the EZ web site just 10 days earlier which clearly indicates that a conforming carry on bag and an additional accessories bag was acceptable my wife and I found ourselves along with plenty of other passengers in a difficult space trying to squeeze our accessories bags into a single carry on. Having got into the plane that was about 2/3 full the PA system was telling us that small bags should be stowed under the seats in front of us. Clearly the people at EZ have no idea about presenting a uniform message. In my case 3 different messages. Does the left hand really know what the right hand is doing? A further delay occurred when the ground staff wouldn't issue a receipt for GBP 45 for an unfortunate passenger who couldn't squeeze 2 into 1 and it had to go in the hold. Rightly she refused to board the plane until a receipt was provided which saw us with a departure delay of around 30 minutes. The aircrew seemed more interested in themselves than providing a customer focused service.",

Made my case fuller than it had previously been but rules I suppose are rules despite that the seem to be different at each airport.

Informative flight deck and friendly cabin crew who for not one moment do I think want be be greeting every single passenger onboard but they do it and it's invaluable in my opinion leading to positive customer perception. Naturally being an airline of it's type anything you want onboard bar the toilet is chargable. Not a problem as what's on offer is priced reasonably the selection being good and if it's hot food you're purchasing it comes to you hot not lukewarm. Cabin crew seem to be far more visible during the flight than on some airlines which is undoubtedly a positive. Whilst no one expects them trolling the aisles for the who flight it is great to see them other than during cabin preparation and service times. Definitely an airline I'd have no hesitation in recommending. Comfortable on time flight priced competitively clean and comfortable cabin. Wishful thinking would have me hope some of the national airlines would embrace some of easyjets best practices but that will never happen so easyjet where practicable and price dependant would always be my first choice.",

This wasn't much of an issue as it was only about 10 minutes but I didn't see the point of checking in ourselves. The aircraft was clean and tidy and the seats were comfortable enough for just over 2 hours. We were late taking off by 5 minutes which doesn't matter as we made up the time. The food on board was nice and not too expensive for airline food. Cabin crew were lovely and professional and captain was very informative. I thought this flight was better than the Thomson flight I took 6 months ago which was double the price!",

 'text': u"EZY5336 17th July 2014. On the plus side Easyjet are pretty punctual but two issues made recent trips just too irritating. Firstly the baggage drop at Gatwick is woeful. You really should not need to arrive 2.5 hrs before departure and queue for an hour or so just because EZ can't be bothered to have all the desks open (or rent some more). Staff shout out destinations so those about to miss their flight can go to the front of the queue. Perhaps it's better not to arrive too early and just wait for the 'late shout' - it's probably quicker! It's not as if EZ don't know how many customers are due to arrive each day so they really should plan things better. The 2nd irritation is being called to 'board' when at the gate. This isn't really boarding at all because typically you just show your boarding card and passport and enter a holding pen (eg Toulouse) and wait there sometimes for 20 minutes or so. Again it's for Easyjet's convenience/saving not the customers'. Why call family groups first so > they can stand for longer rather than call them last? Sometimes Easyjet can be good value but often they are about the same price as flag carriers but the service remains very budget airline. For me I'd pay a small premium for a decent airline. But if you don't mind queues shouty staff and noisy sales announcements on board they're OK. Better than Ryanair though.",

We even saw bigger bags than our one going in the overhead lockers! We told a crew member and he said "Well I\'m not checking the bag sizes." No customer courtesy! Next my grandmother is disabled and when we boarded the plane since one of our family members booked the flight didn\'t choose the seats they gave us a window and a middle seat. My grandmother is claustrophobic and has arthritis. We asked if she could have an aisle seat and said there was nothing that could be done and that she would have to take that seat. Not one bit of sympathy! The man who had the aisle seat was kind enough to let her sit on the aisle and he sat at the window! No courtesy from the staff! No help!

Seat assignment worked fine so the boarding was smooth even though a bit slow both ways as they start to queue people at the gate well in advance. The best things were price and schedule which is what makes you choose a low cost carrier at the end.

 'text': u"LGW to INV. 1) 'Bag drop' and online check in a complete joke when you still have to join a mammoth snake like queue and basically 'check in' anyway! What's the point? 2) Those passengers who do pay extra to check in their hold baggage are only discriminated once on board. The new cabin baggage policy means most passengers take trolley bags on - fair enough. However those who don't and have a small bag or daypack are expected to forfeit their leg room so trolley bags go in the stowage bins. 3) Nice new clean aircraft attentive crew. Pity the magazines were stained torn pages missing and out of date. Basic service. If you can't be bothered replacing them please don't have them in the seat pocket. I gave up looking for the 'menu' because the magazines were filthy. 4) Sorry bring back full service airlines. Altough Easyjet do a good job of letting you know your flying low cost are their prices really that low?",

Remember it is 135km away. My son quickly goes to toilet gets through passport control and gets his suitcase (one of last off carousel) goes to find bus and nothing - no Easyjet rep no directions nothing. He reckons max 10 mins from when he got his suitcase to when he was out in foyer/concourse etc. Eventually he finds the Easyjet Malaga desk on a different floor basically zero interest tough. Numerous calls to Easyjet UK - absolutely hopeless said they had no obligation to get you to your end destination if you missed a bus they provided they admit they never do a head count on the bus. We have a 16 year old 135kms from his destination and Easyjet on site answer is "tough go and use public transport".',

This entailed a walk to a bus to enable passengers to get to baggage claim. Of course with my wife requiring wheelchair assistance we were kept on the plane till an "ambulance" vehicle arrived to take us to baggage claim. This took up to close to an hour while a friend waited in flight arrivals to take us home. Overall not good enough.',

Actually in Berlin and Pisa they announce "boarding" while the plane is not actually there put all the passengers in the small room with no fresh air and place to seat. Above mentioned airports are very small and look like hangars. Easyjet writes that the boarding ends 30 minutes before flight while actually it opens 30 minutes before or sometimes even later!. The positive thing is that their flights are more or less on time and the tickets are relatively cheap (but not always).',

Anyway to cut a long story short we were put in a 4* Marriott Hotel full board for an additional 3 nights at no cost to ourselves.

 'text': u"I have been flying with easyjet for years on a regular basis and have recently been disappointed with how rapidly their customer service has declined. The last 3 times I have attempted to fly with easyjet have been disastrous and unnecessarily stressful with little compassion or understanding from staff who can only read legal requirements. The first was when I had a flexifare and attempted to change to earlier flight as per the terms and conditions of this flight but due to an error of assigning the right reference number they charged me a whole new fare. A month later I was going home for the weekend to see my family (I live in London my family in Belfast) and arrived at the airport on Friday to be told the flight was overbooked and they could offer me a flight on Sunday afternoon which of course was useless. This flight was reimbursed with the standard compensation which only just covered the return flight I lost as this was with a different airline. Finally last weekend when I didn't think easyjet could ruin another trip for me I arrived at the airport intending to get my 8pm flight to Edinburgh but the plane had been 'substituted' for another flight so we would only get our flight at around 1am! I asked customer service if they could arrange a hotel or taxi as I would be arriving to a city at 2.30am and I had been planning to make an onward journey but they refused saying my options were 1) to accept the delayed flight and get a refreshment voucher 2) take the 9.30 flight to Glasgow. I decided to go to Glasgow and would have made the last train to my onward destination but low and behold that flight was also delayed. So instead of arriving at 9.30pm to Edinburgh I arrived to Glasgow at 11.20pm. I asked for a refreshment voucher but was told I had a choice between accepting the late flight with a voucher or the Glasgow flight - what options! Easyjet will push away their loyal customers for becoming too greedy.",

Like they didn't know how many tickets they had booked for the day? Those passengers who had close departing flights were given priority so those of us who had arrived at the airport in appropriate time were made to wait even longer. After this fiasco we were informed our flight was 2+ hours delayed but we had to wait at the gate the entire time in case they decided to take off earlier. Completely unorganized and uninformed every time I use this discount airline I pay with patience. Flying out of London last year was the same story - ridiculous wait times just to drop the baggage.

The journeys each way were well up to the standards we have always encountered when flying with easyJet: friendly and helpful cabin crews informative flight deck and no hassle at the departure gates. We were held for a time between the gate and the plane in each direction but still managed to depart marginally ahead of schedule and arrive a few minutes early in both cases. The only aspect that detracted from the overall experience was the seating on the A320 for our return flight: instead of the familiar easyJet seats we were faced with what looked like slimline (even economy!) seats. They seemed to offer a little more leg room and possibly better cabin visibility but the three of us all independently commented on the lack of comfort after less than an hour of a three hours' flight. The seats lacked padding and seemed foreshortened as did the armrests My rating for seat comfort is therefore based half on the outward leg and half on the return leg. I hope these uncomfortable seats do not become standard in the future.",

Being able to pre-book a seat on Easyjet is a major step up from the free-for-all chaos of a couple of years ago. The charges for hold luggage are excessive but then this is an airline designed with city breaks in mind so hand luggage should accommodate most people's needs. No in-flight entertainment but don't most people revert to their phones / laptops / tablets these days anyway? Onboard food and drink are pricey but not ridiculously expensive and perfectly adequate compared to some of the muck served by other airlines. Have flown EJ before will do again.",

We were told that there was a technical fault and they would have to fly a plane from the UK which would delay our flight by 7.5 hrs. We were given a \xa34.50 voucher for food which is an absolute joke. Passengers were treated with great disdain staff were rude and unhelpful and they even left a very old couple in wheelchairs to their own devices. Anyway we decided to get another flight with BA but had a terrible struggle to get our bags back. We were told that now we had booked other flights Easyjet took no responsibility for our bags as it was BAs responsibility to get our bags off the Easyjet plane on the runway! We eventually got our bags after lots of chasing and managed to get our BA flight within the nick of time. Apparently the Easyjet plane finally departed 11 hours late. We will never travel with them again.',

Lots of communication from the flight deck and arrived 20 minutes early. Bags delivered promptly.

Pushed back approximately 3 minutes early departed with an expected flight time of 1hour and 50 minutes. Plane was absolutely immaculate and again the crew were fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble and everything was handled professionally. Landed at Luton 20 minutes early bags again delivered within 5 minutes of clearing immigration.

Their size has been acceptable on dozens of other flights with Easyjet and other airlines as they are made to fit within the airline in cabin sizing.

My fault but the fact that easyJet operate from both terminals at Gatwick is unusual and they should do more to point this out to people before they join the long bag drop queue in South terminal. Fair enough the queues move fast and staff call out the flights that are closing but that isn't much help to you if you are in the wrong terminal altogether. Fortunately in our case we realised our error quickly and we got to north terminal and made our flight but I would argue that the bag drop system needs serious improvement. The actual flight was ok but the seat pitch is unacceptable for such a long flight. It is ok to read but not enough to work on a laptop - this is an issue for business travellers. The only good thing about easyjet is the coffee which is much better than their competitors. The allocated seating is also an improvement but we were allocated seats across the aisle from one another not ideal. I would say easyjet have some way to go before they can say they are really competing with BA etc for business travellers. They need to seriously look at what Norwegian are doing.",

I have returned from a lovely holiday from Portugal today-the flight was slightly delayed due to Air Traffic Control problems in France but this did not affect my experience in the slightest. When it came time to start descent (which I was not aware of) one of the cabin crew tapped me on the shoulder to ask me to put my earphones and phone away on which I was watching a movie. I put everything away in double quick time as soon as I was asked and pushed my bag under the seat in front. As she walked off behind me I heard her comment to either a colleague or another passenger "there\'s always one". I was very annoyed by this and advised one of her colleagues on the way off the plane. I deliberately hung back until most of the passengers had got off so that I did not cause a scene and I deliberately did not go to the woman in question so that it did not get out if hand. The other lady assured me that they have a debrief after every flight and that my comments would be discussed. The whole point of putting the headphones in and watching the movie was for me not to disturb anyone and cabin noise not to disturb me so I was not being ignorant. However her colleagues response to my comment was very professional and reassuring.',

Thinner seat backs and everything more streamlined made for a much more spacious seat pitch and a more comfortable journey. We could not fault it at all. We have never had any problems with Easyjet airport or aircraft staff and we wonder if any negative reviews towards staff are actually 'Easyjet' staff and not in fact the airport staff from the airport they are departing from and therefore nothing to do with Easyjet? We really cannot understand the reviews on here with regards to luggage. Easyjet (along with all airlines including Low- cost) clearly state their hold and hand luggage policy.

 'text': u'GVA-LGW LGW-BSL. I have no problem with the flights (full both ways) and the extra-ordinary amount of hand luggage onboard the cabin crew are very pleasant and do a good job. The bag drop at both GVA and LGW is appalling. 55mins to check a bag in at GVA (and half the drop off points closed) 45mins at LGW (all the points open just not enough of them). easyJet seem to have spent a fortune enticing business travellers - complete waste of money if they expect a Business traveller (let alone a holiday maker) to stand shuffling along in a snake-like queue just to check in a bag! Until they get their act together I would avoid them simply unacceptable and treating their clients with contempt.',

 'text': u"Paris to London. The crew member in the boarding line was extremely rude abrupt and uninformative. It was all in relation to cabin baggage being more than one bag mind you the second bag for us was a tiny handbag. We flew from Italy to Paris with no problems carrying exactly the same baggage. We were then rudely pulled out of the line and asked if we understood English in a condescending voice after being given no time to try and fit our handbags into our luggage. We were then sent to the boarding desk because we couldn't fit one in. The crew member there had no idea why we were sent there so he sent us back. We were then told it was going to cost an extra 55 Euro for a bag 1cm thicker than the allowed thickness which is outrageous not to mention we were well under our weight limit. I then noticed that some other passengers had cabin baggage as big as the one we had to pay extra for and put in the hold and also a large handbag or briefcase. In one country we are allowed certain things and the next we are not. For the same company in these countries policies and procedures are different obviously as a result of poor management. I would not recommend anybody use this airline I would rather pay extra for another airline and will be in future.",

 'text': u'Returned recently from Barcelona back to Newcastle paid for one case in the hold and carried one shoulder bag onto plane couldn\'t believe the size of the cases people were carrying onto flight some bigger than my case! No one was asked to put bag into bag sizer or indeed no check in staff even bothered to look over the counter. My issue I have with this is apart from stupidly paying for a suitcase when I could easily as it turns out take into the cabin but I was also refused to put my bag into the overhead lockers as they "have to accommodate the larger cases"! My shoulder bag was the proper size for the flight but as it turns out it was too small. I was told that I had to put it on the floor along with my coat (it was too tall to fit under the seat in front) I had a very uncomfortable 3hrs unable to move my legs the crew member was extremely rude and didn\'t care about the discomfort. Surely the airlines need to have an idea of the weight of the luggage on board an aircraft? At Newcastle there was virtually no hold baggage apart from ours. If we had been the last on the flight I could understand it if there was no space in the lockers but I was on fairly early in the queue the cases overhead were crammed and one of them was taped closed obviously previously overloaded?',

 'text': u'19th Feb 2014 Gatwick North Terminal to Tenerife South airport. Online booking:\u2013Easyjet have a very user friendly website and their email communication was superb. Baggage charge: I found the \xa318 charge for a small bag to be outrageous. Bag Drop: the bag drop was straightforward and the staff member efficient but unsmiling and not at all friendly. Boarding: orderly enough but the announcements were not very clear and I saw 2 elderly people struggle unaided. The cabin crew were not at all friendly and seemed disorganised too. One member of the cabin crew was particularly unfriendly and gruff in the way in which he interacted with a young mum and a baby. Later in the flight I bought a coffee and the same man who was rude to the lady with the baby handed me my change with a phoney smile and the money with a strange expression. I checked the change and saw that rather than a \xa32 coin he had handed me an Arabic coin. I immediately saw this and asked for the correct coinage. It took the efforts of two of his colleagues for me to receive the correct change and no apology. Announcements: there were very few announcements during this journey and no route map at all. The lady captain made one announcement at the end of the flight. Comfort: The seat was rather thin but comfortable enough for the distance flown. Value: the price I paid was quite reasonable. However this was not the cheapest on this route and so I shall shop around in future to make sure I get a good deal.',

The part B of the airport from which Easyjet flights depart looks like a hangar with no ventilation and places to sit. There is a huge line for boarding moving very slow. They started boarding before the plane arrived and all the passengers had to wait in very small room overheated with no fresh air. Also they write that the gate closes 30 minutes before departure while in reality it only starts at this time or even later. I guess that is completely unacceptable even for a low-cost.',

However worse was to come on the return leg from Copenhagen when we were in a 60 minute baggage drop queue due to there being just one desk open - easyjet will not pay for more.

The on-line check-in was relatively simple although we were unable to choose seats for our return flight - however the allocated seats were reserved and we were seated together. Bag drop was simple and extremely well-organised at Gatwick the seats were comfortable and the removal of a reclining function meant that ones knees were never crushed by the person in front! Plenty of leg-room for the average male and the flight attendants were polite and professional. All in all a hassle-free and pleasant experience.',

 'text': u'24th Dec 2013. Manchester to Bilbao. EasyJet was the only company to cancel flights to Bilbao in that afternoon/evening. Weather was improving and all other airlines made it to Bilbao except easyJet. Bilbao airport was never closed. Similar weather conditions days later in Liverpool and not a single easyJet flight was cancelled. Full ticket refund on their website was straightforward so no complaints about that. Staff at Manchester airport were very patient they could not do much about it and had to face all of us frustrated passengers. But equally it was clear that the company had not a clear plan to bring their customers to their destination their advice was more like go home. In spite of all that easyJet when it operates their flights they tend to be very good only when things go out of the ordinary they tend to be very bad. I would still recommend easyJet but passengers should think twice before booking flights on certain important dates without a plan B.',

 'text': u"Like many we had a horrendous experience travelling or trying to travel with easyjet from/to Gatwick on 24/25 of Dec. Nothing can excuse the abysmal treatment by easyjet of the passengers who were forced to await repatriation from Malaga on 24th Dec. Poor information of passengers throughout especially on the 24th with passengers lurching from delay to delay eventually ending in cancellation after a 7-8 hour wait in the terminal. Being given a voucher for the value of 4.50 Euros in an airport in which a can of coke costs 3.70 Euros and a brownie 3.50 Euros. Having to queue for 2 hours to rebook following cancellation with 200 passengers served by 2 staff eventually reduced to 1 after which we were all told that all the rebooking was useless as we could rebook ourselves or check in normally the following day. Ferried to a hotel and having to queue in the rain and wind for over an hour while a single person was booking in 200 passengers one at a time. Ferried back to the airport the next day at 11 am only to be left in terminal C for over 7 hours with virtually all facilities shut down no attempt to hand out any snacks or refreshment and only one harassed easyjet rep in attendance being clearly out of his depth unable or unwilling to announce anything and to address anything. Absence of sensible and correct information from easyjet with the only source of semi-reliable information coming from passengers with access to the web or contacts in the UK. Had to endure hours of waiting as an aircraft scheduled to take us to Gatwick was diverted to Alicante without explanation for hours with wild rumours circulating on its destination chances of its return and any time estimates. Offered crisps or some low-cost choc sweet and a drink as compensation\u201dfor the 7-hour food-less/drink-less wait in an otherwise abandoned terminal. My own verdict is that easyjet's support framework in Malaga is totally inadequate and poorly equipped to deal with unforeseen events. Staff are poorly trained and poorly motivated having no understanding of the importance of talking to passengers and keeping them informed. Your food arrangements in case of serious delays are ludicrous all characteristic of an airline who has forgotten (or never learnt) the importance of customer relations alongside its raison d'etre of maximising its profits.",

 'text': u'Manchester to Geneva EZY1949 18 October 2013. Easyjet service has declined over time and one feels more like being herded (like sheep) more than being a valued customer that brings in profit. It feels customers are being squeezed for all they can get out of them. Today was another such example. I had booked tickets for my son on October 2 and he arrived at the airport in time but was told that the flight was overbooked and there were no more seats. He could wait as two people had not shown up. Furthermore there were no more flights for the day. What was he to do sleep at the airport.? They did not even apologise. We were in a panic as we as a family had booked onward flights and he had appointments. How can they overbook when we had booked well over two months ago. It was not that my son just showed up hoping to get on the flight. This is unacceptable.',

Obviously as a "no frill\'s" airline you don\'t get "free food" or films etc but that said you don\'t pay for it either and if you want to eat there is good choice on board and for a couple of hours you don\'t need much anyway.

But I cannot believe the difference - Easyjet now beats the full-service carriers not only on cost but on most other aspects as well. Paying to choose seats makes a huge difference but it\'s not just that - the whole experience was so good on both sectors that I had to keep reminding myself that I was not flying with a flag-carrier. Friendly helpful professional and good-humoured crew on both flights flights on time no baggage/boarding card issues and seat pitch slightly better than expected (but you will struggle if you\'re over 5\'11" I\'ll admit). Warm food available too - which was surprising. I\'ve flown with 5 different airlines this year and only the flights with Qatar were better than this. I\'m planning on flying this route again very soon and Easyjet will definitely be the first choice next time.',

Baggage in the cabin is becoming a joke (a couple with a small toddler loaded 3 cases!) but we were asked to put our coats on the dirty floor or sit through the entire flight baking hot with them on our laps - not sure how we were expected to eat or drink anything in comfort as the table could barely be deployed! The overhead storage area was choc-a-block so I wonder if our group had also taken cases to go in the cabin - where on earth would it have been put! Maybe next time we won't pay extra and just wait for them to put the overload/surplus in the hold anyway unless of course they ask us to put it on our laps!

 'text': u"Luton - Olbia - Gatwick. Luton airport's small terminal resembled a crowded low-end shopping mall with a large food court. The passenger security check was well-managed. There was little seating in the almost-windowless departure lounge though there was somewhere to buy a coffee amid the duty free gauntlet. You wouldn't want to be delayed here. The walk from terminal entrance to boarding gate was relatively short as was the quick taxi from aircraft parking stand to take-off. At the boarding gate (gate 16) many passengers crowded precariously for at least 10 or 15 minutes over the entire length of a long and steep stairway with their cabin baggage before being able to access a small ground-level room where passports and boarding cards were slowly checked before exiting into the open air to walk across the tarmac to board the plane parked nearby. My single carry-on bag complied exactly with the airline's specified 56 x 45 x 25cm maximum dimensions including handles and wheels. At the boarding gate a member of Easyjet staff selected passengers with wheeled bags from the queue for baggage assessment. My bag did not quite fit a metal- framed gauge indicating that it was over-sized. I was required to check it in and pay a \xa340 fee on the spot. Not negotiable. The gate staff were blunt unsympathetic and appeared hardened to this procedure which felt like a scam. I still had to carry the bag to the aircraft steps and locate a hold-baggage loader to accept it. After boarding had finished there was ample empty space in the overhead lockers for my regulation-size cabin bag. Admittedly my soft- shell Samsonite wheelie was full which may have distorted the dimensions slightly but Easyjet's exacting customer- unfriendly approach felt 'out to get'. Be warned! On the return flight from Olbia my bag - the very same bag - just fitted a similar gauge and I was allowed to take it in the cabin. On both flights the cabins were tidy but with grubby carpet. There was no choice of seat (unless you opted to pay more in advance) which was randomly allocated at the time of online check in. The seat pitch was very tight though just tolerable for a two-hour flight; not for anything longer. The cabin crew both outbound and inbound were friendly and efficient but did nothing to stop noisy young children from running up and down the aisle throughout the entire flight and also made too many announcements. The announcements promoting food and tax-free sales and so many price-savings were intrusive and relentless. Pity the Easyjet frequent-flier! There was no complimentary in-flight catering but drinks and some over-priced unhealthy snacks were offered for sale. The outbound flight departed from Luton on time and arrived a few minutes early in Olbia. The return flight began boarding on time in Olbia but departed 30 minutes late. This delay appeared to be due to desperately inefficient ground handling staff at the boarding gate in Olbia who seemed to lack any sense of interest in getting the flight away on time. We made up some time during the journey and landed 20 minutes late into Gatwick. We arrived at Gatwick North terminal though the flight was sold as arriving at Gatwick South terminal. The boarding pass also indicated arrival at Gatwick South terminal. No announcement as to the change of terminal was made by the crew and anyone unfamiliar with Gatwick airport would have been unaware. The potential for this anomaly to cause problems for customers with pick-up arrangements is obvious. Overall Easyjet was a third-rate airline experience. Bare minimum transportation for a full-service price and the feeling of having been ripped-off.",

 'text': u'Milan Malpensa-Berlin SXF. I fly them I know exactly what to expect for the money I pay and I stick to their baggage regulations which look more than "spartan". To be honest I got what I wanted boarding on time landing on time seats comfortable and the prices for beverages were definitely lower then those at the airport. They look like a very good alternative to the not-low-cost airlines which are expensive and do not worth the money. I will fly them often for short trips in Europe and small vacations around the continent. Their business model seems to make a difference since they are expanding their network all the time. Looking forward to see what they can do.',

On the return flight our flight was delayed for more than 2 hours Easyjet gave us \xa33 voucher each which was even insufficient to buy a sandwich and a cup of coffee in an expensive airport likes KEF.

Sure it is very cheap but you don't actually get what you pay for you get much less. For a vacation it will make you stressed that you paid 50 euros in additional fees there and 50 euros in additional fees back. For a business trip it will make you uncomfortable for the rest of your journey abroad knowing that you had no space to breathe and sat in a poorly-maintained aircraft as transportation. It was my first time flying easyJet and definitely my last. Listen to the reviews above because these are true stories and I just experienced a common negative review above. EasyJet forced me to check my bag in for 50 euros one-way at the gate even though I have taken this bag every time I travel as a carry on. The surprise fees at the gate were more expensive than my ticket. Don't let the low prices online fool you.",

On arrival the engineers came over to the aircraft and we were told that the problem could not be fixed so we were off loaded and went back into the airport terminal. We were given a voucher for \xa33 per person and we went back into the departure lounge. Easyjet flew a replacement aircraft from London Gatwick and we took off 5.5 hours late. Now a few points: there were people moaning and groaning the usual but I cannot praise Easyjet enough. Onboard the aircraft before we were off loaded the pilot kept us informed and invited us to the cockpit to ask any questions we had. The logistics off replacing that aircraft from another airport was I thought brilliant. The service was brilliant on board. The return journey was fabulous and the crew were brilliant as well and I have great respect for Easyjet and enjoy flying with them and they have no comparisons with any other low cost carrier. And another thing on return we had an email from customer service apologising about the delay.',

Yes the food wasn't cheap but in quality and price it compared favourably with UK rail and motorway services offerings.

 'text': u"Alicante to Gatwick 11th October 2013. Hand baggage only and checked in on my iPhone the app was very easy to use. There was a little confusion at the gate about which queue was what (i.e. Speed Boarding and the Other Queue) however announcements were made to clarify the confusion. One bag policy was an irritation (as was their militant- style checks of it) given that Monarch have now relaxed this as long as both bags fit within the allowance. Very warm welcome onboard by the crew. Seating tight but not too uncomfortable for a short flight - wouldn't fly with them mid-haul in those seats however. Allocated seating is a great improvement although there is still a mad rush to board for locker space. A fear seems to exist on low cost carriers in regards to this but I don't find this same mad rush on BA flights (when passengers tend to carry even more hand luggage). Selection of food and drink very extensive. Not too many announcements and no pushy sales. Service very warm and friendly. On time arrival and quick disembarkation. If easyJet can get smooth out the last remaining 'low cost feel' ruffles from their product (issues with hand luggage and more options to pay extra for space i.e. a blocked middle seat) I would consider them on par with BA 's product in Europe. easyJet have come a long way and overall I was quite pleased with the journey experience.",

 'text': u'5 return trips with easyJet this year and all have been eminently satisfactory: no hitches no delays no unwelcome extra charges. If it were not for easyJet we would not be able to afford so many foreign trips. Moreover we have always found easyJet staff efficient friendly and helpful. Our most recent trip from Liverpool to Palma and back was typical: on the outward journey the computer system at the boarding gate was down but the agents just got on with checking us through "manually" with one of them relaying our boarding card numbers over the phone. Despite this we were only a few minutes late leaving and that was partly because 2 elderly passengers had gone to the wrong gate. When they arrived they were gently guided to their seats and as they apologised for getting lost the stewardess simply said "Never mind you\'re here now". The boarding agents at Palma were equally amiable and very tactful when \'non - Speedy Boarders\' joined the Speedy Boarders queue. The introduction of allocated seating seems to have made the whole boarding process more relaxed though it does mean that you can no longer vet the passengers in your immediate vicinity before sitting down: on one of our flights we had to suffer seat kicking children behind us with parents who took no notice.',

They will not allow you to put anything under the seat in front of you so your purse is your carry-on and they\'ll charge you to check what should be your carry-on bag. Most European rollers are smaller than U.S. ones so your roller won\'t work. Our first flight from Brussels to Berlin cost us 50 euros extra when they took my roller at the gate. My husbands roller was allowed. On the second easy jet flight from Berlin to Paris we paid the counter charge of 30 euro for my roller only to have my husbands roller denied at the security line adjacent (literally) to the ticket counter for which we paid another gate fee of 50 euro even though we hadn\'t left the lobby. While in the security line a woman on our flight was worried about the time. She said "I know this airline and if you\'re not at the gate a half hour before departure they will deny you boarding". So we begged ourselves to the front of the line and ran to the gate. At least in Brussels they were calling people up on a flight that was next to depart. If you are under 25 and making a short trip then take easy jet. If you are an American on an extensive trip avoid them. What you save in air fare is not worth the fees you will pay at the airport. I will say the inflight crews were very nice.',

 'text': u"LCA-LGW. Historically I have been a fan and supporter of EZY but this was my first long flight with the airline and taught me that the business model translates very badly to longer stage lengths - I don't expect a hot meal and free newspapers - my flight was a nightmare due to a simple collision of demographics. The two passengers behind me were incredibly badly behaved obviously drunk when they boarded and the cabin crew served them each two Stellas and 6 double G&Ts. Cabin crew on commission are never going to not serve someone another round of drinks. These particular passengers made everyone around them's flight absolutely miserable. I don't even mind a bit of bad behaviour on a short flight going to EDI or HAM or somewhere it can even be a source of comedy but on a 4+ hour night flight I and my neighbours should not expect to have our seats kicked deliberately and be sworn at. I will fly EZY again on short haul but over about 2hrs the risk is simply too great of being mixed in with people who don't know how to behave and are in no fit state to fly. The 20 minute delay on the taxiway after landing and parking at the\u201cwrong\u201dterminal (South instead of North) because they wanted the aircraft parked at the South terminal for the first flight out the next morning caused a lot of inconvenience and was a final twist of the knife to finish off a horrible experience.",

At the check in procedure an impolite female employee asked us to put our hand luggage bag in the gauge. No problem at all. Although the whole bag went in I had to put a little force to take it out since it is a hard plastic one and stuck in there. She refused to let us take it to the plane and charged us \xa369.00 (25 for the bag and 44 for 4kgs overweight of our 3 bags). When I informed her that we used this bag many times on Easyjet flights before - the last one being 5 days before on our travel from Paphos to Gatwick - she refused to accept. Our lovely 5 day London holiday was ruined. Needless to say that other people on the flight had much thicker and bigger had luggage allowed on the plane. Furious and Disgusted.',

So you seat on an aircraft with no money to buy refreshments no accessible passport and none of the other items that make a flight more bearable. It is humiliating to have your boarding pass confiscated while you struggle to put your handbag (even a small one) into an already full very small cabin bag while other people sail past you with their duty free bottles of wine clanging merrily away.

 'text': u"Luton to Geneva. Always surprised by their baggage policy. I was just 1 kg over (21 kgs) and the check in assistant charged me. It's not a problem but I was just thinking the person in front of me weighed at least 95 kgs and is not charged for their 20kg bag. I weigh 65 kgs and have to pay for 1 kg over. Appreciate you cannot charge based on a person's total weight but for some reason it seems unfair. Also they are not very consistent - I often carry 21 kgs on Easyjet and they do not charge anything - could depend on the mood of the Easyjet check in assistants. At Luton the assistant said the Managers had asked them to charge every person on that day.",

The cabin crew especially on the return flight were very friendly and clearly enjoyed their jobs as they were joking with us and other passengers. They were also very professional. The seats are comfortable with good legroom although if you have longer legs you may want to upgrade to the exit row seats. There is also a wide range of items to buy as gifts at good prices which we took advantage of. The aircraft (same both ways) was in excellent condition and very clean; the flights both left on time and arrived at the destination early. Only had hand luggage and what was interesting in how quite a few people seem to have massive bags as hand luggage Easyjet were very lenient in not enforcing the rule a certain other airline would have made a fortune in oversized baggage! I only wish that Easyjet could open a base at BHX one day!',

We needed to check luggage. Although we could see our flight posted on the overhead Departo signs we searched asked and tried to manage baggage check-in for the next 2 hours. No luck. During that time I asked 3 easyJet employees for help thinking that the Orly flight was an intermediate stop and that I was just missing something in looking at the destination postings for baggage check- in. Staff refused to answer. I also asked other passengers in line. No one knew anything but the Departo signs continued to ask us to use Area "A" which was the area we were calmly/patiently standing according to guides on our tickets. When we finally had our turn to talk with an easyJet baggage attendant he was angry and blamed us for not seeing the flight destination posted. Yet at no time in the 2 + hrs we stood in line waiting to find where to check our baggage in area A was there a Paris posting. The "departo" sign now said "boarding". We had missed the flight. I will not fly easyJet again.',

Plane was delayed 2 hours due to a technical fault. However staff were most professional and pleasant they kept us informed and entertained. The plane was spotlessly clean. Our return was also simple and easy with no hitches whatsoever. The airport was organised and calm (unlike Air Malta) We have given up on speedy boarding as with pre booked seats I don't feel there is a need for it. On our previous flight my son was asked to move from his pre booked seat to accommodate people with young children however this did not happen on either of these flights perhaps Easy Jet have listened to comments on here regarding this matter.

Cabin crew were friendly and efficient and landed in Barcelona 20 minutes early. Return flight back to Southend was practically the same as the inbound flight quick bag drop queue and security in Barcelona Terminal 2C. This time we were bussed from the gate to the aircraft which was orderly and no scrum. We even had the same cabin manager on this flight as we did on the outbound flight. Landed in Southend 15 minutes early and was back home within 25 minutes after we landed. I definitely be flying Easyjet and flying from Southend again in the near future.",

 'text': u"Gatwick to Kefalonia (LGW-KEF). Ticket purchase fairly easy online but printing the boarding pass and online check-in could be made simpler. Due to the early departure I checked my luggage in the night before. Arrived the next morning and saw that at 5.30am they were still full. Shocked that at security at Gatwick I went straight to an x-ray machine! No queues! Eateries rammed as it was the start of the school holidays. Gate announced on time. At the gate they called all those with reserved seats and speedy boarding first. Told to go to the front of the bus and cram in there. Non-priority pax got on the same bus. Longest journey to the plane round the back of the airport and across most of it. At the plane the driver opened only the front door so speedy pax could exit first but as easyJet allocates seats you don't get the disgusting crush and rush as you do on Ryanair. Clean cabin. Thanked by the captain for boarding quickly but then told that the flight was to be delayed due to Air Traffic Control not giving them a slot until 2hrs later! I missed my connecting ferry. Captain came on and said the slot had been pushed back even further to 10am. Crew came down with free water a couple of times. Eventually take off 2 hours late. Fairly uncomfortable for a long flight when you add the extra time on the ground in. Crew were very cheery and professional. The chicken wrap I got had limited fillings and was very dry. The box of crisps were over salty and very oily. Next time I'll buy something at the airport to bring on board. Arriving at Kefalonia we were behind another flight so had to wait to clear immigration a bit and for our bags to arrive. Mine was the last one off! Easyjet are preferable to Ryanair and in some respects to the charter airlines that fly this route so I'd probably fly them again unless the old BMI charter flies again under BA colours.",

I was especially impressed with the way they took the time to engage with my young children on both flights. On our return flight the air con was producing vapour during take off due to it being so hot outside and the crew made a special announcement just to reassure passengers as some were concerned it was smoke. The captain also warned us to expect turbulence just after take off and took time to explain why it may occur. Whilst seating is rather tight it is no worse than many other airlines and the service is far superior to that of many major scheduled airlines. Snacks and drinks are not badly priced and the coffee is pretty good which is more than can be said for other airlines I have flown with recently. I will definitely be using them again in the near future.',

I checked to see if the flight was on time before I left and it was. By the time I arrived at the airport it was delayed. So I went online to check the flight status and it still said "on time". I went down to the Easyjet counter on the ground floor to report this (politely at first) and was met by a miserable woman who brushed me off. When I (still politely) persisted she simply ignored me. I then told her (not very politely) that I would report the matter to Easyjet to which she replied she did not work for Easyjet but for another company contracted by Easyjet to handle enquiries! What a nonsense. The flight itself eventually left some time later and arrived without incident.

We found the check in lady unhelpful when we said we would like to put our hand luggage in the hold she said their would be plenty of room onboard as the flight was not full. We were in row 26 and upon boarding there was no room for my daughters luggage and it had to go in an overhead locker at row 3 when telling a crew member where she was sitting they shrugged and said never mind. The staff at Amsterdam airport were much more helpful and pleasant.',

Arrived at check in for our 6am flight about 90 minutes before expecting huge queues. However the new self check-in desks are spread around and staff directed us to one with few people. There was a bit of a delay getting the system to accept the bags but this may have been user error! Gatwick security an absolute breeze even at this very busy time - through in under 4 minutes and service with a smile. Time for a quick coffee before heading to gate. Onboard warm welcome by a very chipper crew and we were away bang on time. Inflight we were well looked after and arrived early. Return equally good with an especially lovely cabin crew. I genuinely don't understand constant negativity towards easyJet. They offer exceptional value and are reliable and customer focused.",

Everything is geared towards themselves rather than the passenger it would appear we are there for their convenience not the other way around. I am fed up of standing around (particularly at Glasgow) when the board is flashing final call and yet we have not moved a millimetre onto the aircraft. Having encouraged us all now to take hand luggage rather than pay the exorbitant prices to put luggage into the hold they are now using gestapo like techniques to force you to put it into the hold as the flights are full. This latest ploy now - no check in staff - is another example of poor customer service. Their flights are no longer cheap and the seat/leg room is nothing short of ridiculous.',

Quick and easy check in on time take off and early arrival back into Manchester. Aircraft was clean with adequate leg room. My gripe is that the flight had around 25 English soldiers flying back to the UK! I have to say the majority were absolutely fine but we had 3 sat in front of us throughout the flight were joined by another friend that stood up directly at the side of me for me for the first 3 hours of the flight. I am all for having a good time but the steady flow of alcohol that was served then lead to disgusting language being used! I spoke to the stewardess about asking the man to sit down in his seat but was told that there was not much they could do. I felt she completely dismissed my comments and was not even willing to speak to them about their language. There should be a cut off point where alcohol is no longer served!',

 'text': u'I arrived at the bag drop queue at Liverpool John Lennon airport at 15.30 for a 17.50 flight (Sunday 16th June). When I joined the queue there were about 70 people ahead of me and only one person a young man who was doing his best and to his credit remained very calm on duty the other staff member being on the Speedy Boarding desk. The queue moved very slowly and was growing I estimated about 120 in total just before they opened a second bag drop desk about 5 minutes before I reached the front after a wait of just under 50 minutes which is completely unacceptable. This complaint is not about the staff concerned but about management who had not foreseen the staffing level required. The number of departures and passengers departing are a known quantity and as far as I am aware there was no unusual circumstance so this is just poor planning or cost saving at the expense of the customer. I travel easyJet a lot sometimes 5 or six flights a month and rarely have cause to complain.',

No rush for boarding like in some other low cost carriers mainly due to the fact that our seats are pre allocated. Plane was almost full however boarding and departure time were not delayed and we got to Funchal nice and early. Onboard crew was nice and made us feel welcome. Onboard food has got to be purchased however most products are quite affordable and of good quality (very tasty muffins by the way).

We arrived at Gatwick nearly 2 hours before the flight to be greeted by a huge queue to check in bags we had to join. I guessed early on that the queue was pointless as there was no way anyone could get through it in time for the flight. The check in staff were just calling people out of the queue just before their flight closed. We had about 5 minutes to check in the bags before the flight closed. I had paid for an extra bag through the web site. Not having used Easyjet for several years I assumed all would be well. But no buying an extra bag does not mean you have extra weight allowance. Told to speak to the supervisor and come back. As we came back we were told the flight had closed. In the end we went back to the supervisor and he managed to get her onto the flight minus the extra bag. I will never fly with them again.',

Easyjet staff in Nice could not have been more helpful and we were treated well. When we eventually boarded our flight the captain explained that they had had a troublesome customer in London who had to be removed from the aeroplane and that meant they were further delayed and missed their slot into Nice. Staff on the flight were wonderful considering they had had a long and stressful day. When we arrived at Gatwick we had missed our connection but EasyJet again came up trumps and put us up for the night free of charge in a hotel. The information desk at Gatwick had not informed us about this and it was only by chance we found out as we thought we would be spending the night on one of the airport benches!

After take off I slid up the window blinder as it was a day flight and I didn't want the sun in my eyes. The blinder stuck and I was unable to slide it down for landing. As we approached Venice we came within 100-200 feet of the ground then pulled up and out of the landing. The co- captain came over the speaker saying 'the pilot decided not to land and there would be more information shortly.' After another fifteen minutes of circling Italy we landed. On the way back we'd noticed that every EasyJet flight was running 15-20 minutes late and every flight had it's gate moved. Our flight went from Gate 19 to Gate 28 for example. After sitting and waiting to board we were jammed into a bus and driven out to the plane. Waiting for takeoff I turned on the air blower above the seat and the panel fell down. The attendants fixed it but that is not at all comforting as you're about to fly. On the flight home I rolled my window blinder up and it stuck again. The flights were loud the seats didn't recline. The in-flight reading had to be purchased though a catalogue of duty-free items was in the seat-back.",

 'text': u'I think the biggest issue with Easyjet is the unlimited hand baggage allowance. Easyjet are now making announcements asking passengers to volunteer to put their baggage in the hold free of charge. How can overhead lockers cope with unlimited weight? This is stupid beyond belief. You have passengers sticking 15 kilos in their hand baggage to save buying hold baggage. Did Easyjet really not see the absolutely obvious outcome of this policy. I constantly see passengers having to move items from hold baggage to hand baggage to avoid additional charges. Sort it out Easyjet.',

 'text': u'Having flown Easyjet since 2005 I can certainly say they have gone downhill. What happened to that friendly fun cabin crew and low cost flights from friendly low cost airports? They have just become a boring and typical traditional airline a bit like a cheap BA. You now have to either reserve seats or hope that you get the seats you want when checking in further increasing the costs if you want to sit together in good seats. I much prefer the format of paying a bit extra for priority boarding and choosing to sit wherever you like. I found cabin crew to be too pushy to sell items as they kept waking people up with announcements every 20 minutes. I also found the range of food and drink on board to be small and were out of stock with most items by the time they were a third of the way down the cabin. They are also concentrating too much on Gatwick Airport and making reductions elsewhere. They stopped flying from East Midlands and have now cut back drastically at Stansted now they serve Southend which is disastrous for anybody living outside of Essex or East London. With now only having any decent service from London Bristol and the Liverpool/Manchester area in England I am finding them increasing unattractive to fly and am sticking more to Ryanair. I will not be looking to fly with them again any time soon if this trend continues!',

As far as I can see this online service is just a way for the airline to save costs and printer ink. Check in took just as long as other airlines despite having my pre-booked seats and pre-printed boarding passes. I had to pay \xa350 fee to "check in" 2 cases as it turns out I hadn\'t completed the process properly. Around 40 minutes to do this. Boarding was chaotic at LGW with speedy board passengers sitting all over the plane and creating congestion with the non speedy board passengers. 30 mins late on take off. Crew were fine and polite. Food was just ok (at an extra charge). On return flight their web site wouldn\'t let me check in the hold baggage so had to call customer services from Spain who told me as I hadn\'t booked direct with them it could only be changed by my travel company or by phone with them. Charged \xa328 to "check in" 2 hold bags. Return: Long wait at bag drop in Fuerteventura. Check in was quite slow and boarding was chaotic. Despite handing over my pre printed boarding pass I was issued with a new one at the bag drop which rather defeats the object of the so called online service. Cabin crew polite and efficient. Plane arrived on time. Total extra charges for trip amounted to around \xa3118 for hold baggage and food. Not good in my opinion.',

Even if the website doesn't allow you to pre-book your baggage on one flight if you book a round trip (\xa3187 + \xa325) it would be better to book another airline. On an anther flight I had no food and beverages on board as the service was too slow so they couldn't save me before landing. I spent 1hr 20mins with no drinks.",

Had booked in one piece of luggage and we had a small trolley case. Check in staff told us to put case in size gauge. We had no worries as this piece of luggage was used in March to travel with easyjet to Geneva. We were wrong as the wheels were not fully in gauge and we had then to pay \xa325. We were angry and embarrassed re this. As we waited to be checked in not one other passenger was asked to even remove their luggage off trolley just us! Spoke to supervisor on site waste of time as expected. She just said she would ensure all staff were advised to check size of hand baggage. This didn't happen. Any way the case was classed as hand luggage on our return trip.",

I recommend at least 2.5 hours with this system so that it gives you more breathing time.

Few gripes on the inbound flight. The first been that they ran out of hot food and virtually everything else by the time they reached us in row 17 and the second been that despite there been a number of babies/kids on board they still insisted on putting the cabin lights on when a lot of people were asleep to do another trolley run. I understand there is a business need but a bit of common sense wouldn\'t go amiss. Legroom wasn\'t too bad given that I am 6\'4". I just wish the cost of flights to Sharm would be a bit more reasonable with Easyjet especially when flights to Dubai are so much less with other airlines.',

On a flight with unallocated seating I would have picked a seat 15 rows away. The next time I flew with them they made me pack my carry on bag in the hold. There were seats which were near empty luggage bins but the bins near my allocated seat were full. It meant I had to hang around waiting for my bag to arrive when I should have been on my way home. They are trying to act like a premium airline but without the infrastructure or the organisation. It takes too long to board so they end up running late. If I'm boarding from a sky bridge then its not so bad to have to wait whilst people find a specific seat. However with Easyjet if I am queuing outside I want everyone onboard and seated as soon as possible. When I've got a choice I will use some other airline.",

 'text': u"Booked Easyjet flight to Tenerife. Booked extra legroom both ways. Got it on the outgoing journey in seats 1A/B/C/D. But there was some complaints behind us as 8 people had booked extra legroom in rows 12 and 13. But the aircraft was changed since they booked and rows 12 and 13 were no longer extra legroom. I was a little concerned as I had booked those extra legroom on the return journey ! I thought it was a blip but you guessed it - the aircraft was also changed on the return journey and our seats were no longer extra legroom. There were 8 other people who were disappointed to. Now interestingly the cabin crew confirmed to us that this was not a last minute change of aircraft as it was shown on their schedule since they were issued some considerable time before. Therefore it seems obvious to me that if Easyjet can't fill a larger aircraft then they put on a smaller one and ignore those passengers who have paid for extra legroom seats which don't exist on the smaller plane. So beware booking an Easyjet flight and booking seats too far in advance because they seem to change aircraft a bit more frequently than you would think.",

 'text': u'MAN-TFS return. Comfortable flight on a fairly new Airbus 320. Paid extra for exit row seats as this was a 4 hour flight and that gave us the option of Speedy Boarding. However not so important now that easyJet have started offering pre-assigned seats which removes the scrum. Speedy Boarding does mean you can drop your bag at a special Speedy Boarding desk rather than queue with the majority of passengers. This saved quite a bit of time at both ends. We had checked in online and the airline\'s website suggests you just turn up and drop your hold baggage. However Easy Jet\'s definition of "bag drop" sees the same lengthy queues at desks that you would get if you were checking in at the airport. Seats were comfortable with the extra legroom that goes with exit seats. Cabin crew efficient and friendly. The food offering is perfectly adequate for the length of journey. Plenty of information from the flight crew. Bit too much use of the PA system by the cabin crew. Altogether I find easyJet perfectly adequate for short haul flights.',
